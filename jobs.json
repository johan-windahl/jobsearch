The department for Mechanics and Materials at Xylem's Sundbyberg office is developing models to facilitate vibration prediction.\n   \n\n  \n\n Student thesis proposal\n   \n\n  \n\n One of Xylem's product categories is Flygt's pumps. Vibrations are usually a challenge in rotating systems like pumps. The department for mechanics and materials at Xylem's office for research and development in Sundbyberg works, among other things, to develop models to predict levels of vibrations for their products.\n   \n\n  \n\n Measurement have shown that the water around a pump is lowering the eigenfrequency. CFD can be used to evaluate the effect of the water, but it is very costly and complex. A more simplified way to calculate the effect of water can be to use an acoustic pressure model. Acoustic pressure model is normally used to calculate the sound pressure.\n   \n\n  \n\n The thesis consists of evaluating the accuracy of a COMSOL Multiphysics solid-acoustic calculation model compare with test measurement. COMSOL Multiphysics is a finite element program. This thesis work will also include practical experiments in our lab in Xylem's office in Sundbyberg to verify the calculation model.\n   \n\n  \n\n The work is carried out on site at Xylem's office in Sundbyberg. The time period is flexible, but preferably during spring 2025.\n   \n\n  \n\n We believe a suitable background is a master\u2019s student from engineering mechanics including solid mechanics or fluid mechanics.\n   \n\n  \n\n Please contact Keith Lothian, Manager of Mechanics and Materials within R&D for questions about the thesis.\n   \n\n  \n\n keith.lothian@xylem.com\n   \n\n  \n\n +46 8 4756941\n   \n\n  \n\n Join the global Xylem team to be a part of innovative technology solutions transforming water usage, conservation, and re-use. Our products impact public utilities, industrial sectors, residential areas, and commercial buildings, with a commitment to providing smart metering, network technologies, and advanced analytics for water, electric, and gas utilities.
