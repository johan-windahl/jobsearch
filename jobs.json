As a B2B company, we power the retail technology behind digital receipts and secure, legally compliant transactions. In Italy, we help retailers go fully digital and eliminate the need for hardware like fiscal printers to issue and manage receipts.\n   \n\n  \n\n By making receipts tamper-proof through digital signatures, we help fight tax fraud.

You won't be manually researching emails for hours. You will leverage Sales Intelligence and AI tools to build targeted lists, craft hyper-personalized outreach, and get in front of decision-makers faster.

We are building a global streaming video platform (OTT), and a suite of applications to support\u00a0all of\u00a0our network\u2019s brands globally. We are building modern container-based micro-services\u00a0operated\u00a0on AWS. Our platform covers everything from search, catalogue, video transcoding, personalization, to global subscriptions, and\u00a0really much\u00a0more. We build user experiences ranging from classic lean-back viewing to interactive learning applications.\u00a0\u00a0We build for connected TVs, web, mobile phones, tablets, and consoles for a large footprint of\u00a0WBD\u00a0owned networks (HBO Max,\u00a0Discovery, Food Network, Golf TV,\u00a0MotorTrend, Eurosport, Discovery Play, and many more).\u00a0\u00a0This is a growing, global engineering group crucial to\u00a0WBD\u2019s\u00a0future.\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We are hiring a Staff Software Engineer within the DTC Operational Engineering group with a focus on Cluster Engineering. The team provides a secure, efficient and easy-to-use container runtime platform. We build automation for expanding it to new markets, tenants and geographical regions, bootstrapping a fully featured container runtime ready for back-end development teams to use.\n \n\n\n\n We team up with other platform teams, manage the lifecycle of critical platform components and work closely with SRE to improve reliability and efficiency of the platform.\n \n\n\n\n We provide strategies and processes for lifecycle management of the container runtime environment. We own critical components, assess when we should introduce new ones and set the bar for quality. We focus on reducing security incidents while ensuring cost-effectiveness and supporting business needs.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n**Your new role:** \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As a Staff Software Engineer on the team, you will be a subject matter expert in Kubernetes, helping to define the overall architecture and driving implementations. You will be a strong contributor to improving our internal developer platform, serving thousands of software engineers across the globe.\n \n\n\n\n Tasks include operating a large fleet of Kubernetes clusters, e.g. version upgrades, security patching, cost optimization, scaling and performance tuning. As part of rolling out upgrades to hundreds of clusters, some ranging up to a thousand nodes, you will identify automation opportunities to reduce the amount of toil needed. To keep our runtime cost low, you will lead cost optimization efforts, like tweaking the Karpenter node scaling strategies, increasing the bin-packing efficiency of pods on nodes, ensuring the right node family type is used (m, c, r, spot and Graviton\/ARM) and identifying over scaled infrastructure.\n \n\n\n\n To enable faster time to new markets and onboarding of new tenants to our streaming platform, you\u2019ll define automation processes for the creation of new Kubernetes clusters together with bootstrapping of critical platform capabilities like service mesh, deployment systems and the observability stack (metrics, tracing, logging).\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n**Preferred Skills:** \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* At least 8 years of software development, infrastructure management or operations experience.\n* At least 5 years of Kubernetes and AWS experience.\n* Experience with architecture design and developing platform solutions.\n* Ability to mentor senior engineers.\n* Experience with leading large technical projects with unclear requirements.\n* Ability to drive decision making and cross-team collaboration.\n* Ability to write quality code for automation in python, bash or golang.\n* Experience with designing infrastructure CI\/CD pipelines, e.g. Jenkins or GitHub Actions.\n* Experience with IaC, preferably Terraform.\n* Used to Helm templating for k8s manifests.\n* Understanding of how GitOps tooling like ArgoCD or Flux works.\n* Experience in rolling out infrastructure changes to production by following a change management workflow.\n* Knowing what metrics to monitor during a change rollout to identify problems.\n* Strong ownership mentality during rollouts, stop\/rollback and fix if problems occur or escalate to management\/on-call if getting stuck.\n* Strong sense of security, always using least privileges access and firewall configurations when needed for maintenance.\n* Understanding of how running workloads on the Kubernetes clusters may be affected by cluster changes or node rotations.\n* Willingness to talk to service development teams and understand their challenges when they report problems during maintenance windows.\n* Ability to define and measure KPIs and honor SLAs for infrastructure maintenance.\n* Experience with Git and GitHub PR workflows.\n* Experience in working with Agile \u2013 Sprints, Epics\/Stories, Jira.\n* Experience with building internal developer platforms using technologies such as backstage\/argo-workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n On June 9, 2025, Warner Bros.
