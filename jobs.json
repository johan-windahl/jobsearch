Majoriteten av min tid p\u00e5 jobbet spenderar jag med att skriva Swift-kod f\u00f6r v\u00e5r iOS-app. Jag har tidigare \u00e4ven kodat en hel del Kotlin till v\u00e5ran Android-app. Jag \u00e4r dagligen med och jobbar hands-on i produkten, och du kommer att jobba med mig i features ibland. Jag \u00e4lskar att svara p\u00e5 fr\u00e5gor, att f\u00e5 st\u00e4lla fr\u00e5gor och att l\u00f6sa problem tillsammans. Jag \u00e4r stationerad p\u00e5 v\u00e5rat satellitkontor i Karlstad tillsammans med en av Androidutvecklarna i teamet, men du och \u00f6vriga delen av teamet sitter i Stockholm. Sj\u00e4lvklart dyker vi upp p\u00e5 kontoret i Stockholm p\u00e5 regelbunden basis, och du och jag kommer att ha mycket kontakt digitalt.\n\n  \n\nDu kommer att spendera st\u00f6rre delen av din tid i v\u00e5r kodbas, som till 100 % best\u00e5r av Kotlin. Allt nytt UI byggs med Jetpack Compose, och vi str\u00e4var efter att kunna k\u00f6ra Compose fullt ut med t.ex. navigation3. Samtidigt lutar vi oss mot en etablerad arkitektur med tydlig uppdelning i lager, d\u00e4r coroutines, repositories och reaktiv datahantering \u00e4r centrala delar.\n\n\nJag tror att du \u00e4r engagerad i det du g\u00f6r och i ditt yrke; du bryr dig p\u00e5 riktigt om det som du och ditt team bygger och vilken effekt det ger.

How do you feel about engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets? If that sounds exciting (even if a bit scary), read on because I\u2019m looking for an engineering manager to help us build a different type of engineering team and culture at Ashby.\n   \n\n  \n\n To start, why do we need to be different? Time and again, I have witnessed engineers knowing what needs to be done yet being unable to get things done because of \u201cthe process\u201d or because \u201cmore data is needed.\u201d Some of the most effective projects have been\n *skunkworks* \n projects, where engineers have taken total ownership of a problem and driven it to completion. I want to normalize that at Ashby.\n   \n\n  \n\n When we think about how these processes came about, we realize they carry a\n *pessimistic* \n mindset. They box people into smaller roles to minimize the chance of not meeting a certain standard. At Ashby. we\u2019re building an environment that is\n *optimistic* \n about what engineers can own and achieve and embraces the innovative engineers (and frankly, often stays out of their way).\n   \n\n  \n\n To accomplish this, our engineering leaders need to think deeply about individual performance, process, and culture - not running sprint planning or driving product and technical decisions. You\u2019ll focus on building your team, their skills to thrive with the ownership they\u2019re given, and an environment that empowers them to do their best work consistently, with little distraction. For junior EMs we try to stay within 6 direct reports. This enables them to spend time with our teams observing, correcting, praising, and, yes, coding. We like our managers to be hands-on while also making sure they\u2019re not on the critical path.\n   \n\n  \n\n We\u2019ve already gathered an experienced, talented, and collaborative team of 25+ engineers. You\u2019ll help me manage the growing team of engineers in Europe.\n   \n\n  \n\n In Addition To Working With Engineers You\u2019ll Also Get To Work On Projects Yourselves. Some Examples Of Work Our Engineering Leaders Have Done\n   \n\n  \n\n* Provide feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don\u2019t make the final decisions, but you\u2019ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.\n* Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects, and deliver them with little intervention. They still ask for help when needed - the difference is that they\u2019re driving.\n* Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).\n* Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It\u2019s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.\n\n\n Why be a manager?\n   \n\n  \n\n I had two experiences early in my career that set me on my path. I had a great manager who asked tonnes of questions about the decisions I was making and coached me without me realizing it. And I had a\n *terrible* \n manager - being told to work harder after a week of 3am finishes was not what I needed as a young engineer. The stark difference between these two experiences motivated me to become a manager: I wanted every engineer I worked with to have the support I had in the best case.\n   \n\n  \n\n Since then, as I\u2019ve learned more, I\u2019ve realized that I love the kind of problems I get to solve as a manager. Deeply complex problems with long-term impact both on the company and on people\u2019s lives. One of my proudest achievements is creating a fully transparent pay system, and on the day it was revealed, everybody was happy with it. Nobody stormed out. By spending time thinking deeply about everybody\u2019s pay and ensuring the mechanics of promotion were clear, I put the team in a place where they could see a peer was paid more than them, and it not be a problem.\n   \n\n  \n\n Despite all this, I love being technical. I sometimes indulge myself and spend a morning writing some code to improve tests or provide better abstractions. If I couldn\u2019t be a manager, I\u2019d be super happy to be an IC.\n   \n\n  \n\n I\u2019m looking for someone who is passionate. Passionate about both management and being technical. Someone who spots a pattern amongst their team, figures out a better way for us to operate, and then builds the automation that powers it. I introduced a new process that enables engineers to merge 30% of PRs without a human review beforehand. I also built the automation that approves these PRs. I\n *also* \n built that automation with abstractions that make it easy for the engineers to improve the automation themselves.\n   \n\n  \n\n It can be hard to find seasoned engineering leaders who haven\u2019t succumbed to the status quo in some way or another. We're committed to giving all our people a total and utter lack of terrible managers, and that means we're willing to take a chance on someone early in their leadership journey who's courageous, principled, and has the drive to build themselves into a great leader who can say \u201cYah I know everyone is doing that, but we won't because...\u201d\n   \n\n  \n\n Why You Should or Shouldn\u2019t Apply\n   \n\n  \n\n Engineering Leadership Comes In Many Flavors, Not All Of Which Fit Our Model. I Thought I\u2019d Outline Some Things I\u2019m Looking For To Help You Decide If This Fits What You\u2019re Looking For\n   \n\n  \n\n* You love being technical and can hold in-depth conversations with direct reports from infra to backend to frontend.\n* You enjoy management problems. We want people who get excited about driving people to be their best, giving difficult feedback, and building systems that make this easier\n* You hold your team to a high standard and don\u2019t shy away from getting into the details and giving feedback, even to the best folks on your team.\n* You are an excellent and empathetic communicator. Facilitating change at both an individual and organization level requires understanding how to navigate the beliefs, opinions, and past experiences of engineers and figuring out how to both convince them of a new way of doing things while also leaving yourself open to feedback.\n* You know what exceptional engineers look like. You\u2019ve thought deeply about what makes them tick, how to recruit them, and how to grow folks into them. I want to see depth here, the industry often regurgitates a vanilla description, but the reality is more nuanced.\n* You\u2019re good at thinking about product, business, and maybe even design, but you\u2019re not interested in calling the shots and are more interested in building a team that can make the best decisions without you.\n* You thrive in high-trust, high-autonomy environments. We're a young startup where leaders wear multiple hats, and you'll build your own (high-speed) on-ramp through developing strong feedback loops.\n\n\n**Put Another Way, You Shouldn\u2019t Apply If**\n* You don\u2019t enjoy coding or don\u2019t find time to stay up-to-date on technology.\n* You\u2019ve gotten into management because it was the only growth path available\n* You want to make all the product decisions instead of empowering your team to make those calls.\n* You're happy with a team of engineers that are predominantly early-career, mid-career, or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy. With enough guardrails, the team can get things done.\n* A staff or principal engineer to you is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews.\n* You\u2019re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently than the status quo. You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers.\n\n\n What We\u2019re Building\n   \n\n  \n\n Talent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!\n   \n\n  \n\n Scheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform \u201cCalendar Tetris\u201d to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. \ud83e\udd75\n   \n\n  \n\n Ashby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they\u2019re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they\u2019re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.\n   \n\n  \n\n We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I\u2019ll share more once we meet.\n   \n\n  \n\n Engineering Culture\n   \n\n  \n\n Our engineering culture is motivated by Abhik and Benji\u2019s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).\n   \n\n  \n\n Collaboration is Natural, Communication is Deliberate\n   \n\n  \n\n Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them here!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (Abhik wrote about it here). Even managers can rely on getting consistent time (and support to make, if necessary) to focus and do creative work without the demand of constant meetings.\n   \n\n  \n\n Increase Leverage, not Team Size\n   \n\n  \n\n We Built Ashby With The Quality, Breadth, And Depth That Many Customers Would Expect From Much Larger Teams Over Larger Time Scales. We\u2019ve Done This Through Investment In\n   \n\n  \n\n* Great developer tooling. Our CI\/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 5x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe\n* Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video on it here).\n\n\n**And a Demo Of One Of These Building Blocks**\n Here\u2019s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it\u2019s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n   \n\n  \n\n Give Engineers Ownership & Autonomy\n   \n\n  \n\n We, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. All of us in technical leadership did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don\u2019t get to practice as engineers, and, as a manager at Ashby, you\u2019ll provide mentorship and feedback to engineers to ensure they are successful when delivering projects.\n   \n\n  \n\n Put Effort into Diversity\n   \n\n  \n\n Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. As the father of two young girls, I want to see them grow up in a world where all industries are open\n *and welcoming* \n to everyone, regardless of race, gender, or preferences. Helping to build a more diverse team at Ashby is my way of contributing to this change.\n   \n\n  \n\n Today, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It\u2019s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n   \n\n  \n\n Interview Process\n   \n\n  \n\n At Ashby, Our Team And Interview Process Want To Help You Show Your Best Self. We\u2019ll Dive Into Past Projects And Simulate Working Together. Our Interview Process Is Six Interviews In The Following Order\n   \n\n  \n\n* Intro Call (30m) - Discuss your application questions, align on the responsibilities of the role, and answer questions about Ashby.\n* Past Experience Deep Dive (1h) - Discuss your past experience as an engineering leader.\n* Technical Screen (1h) - Add a feature back to Ashby. You'll spend most of your time understanding a specific part of our codebase and write less than 15 lines of code.\n* Coffee Chat with VP of Engineering (1h) - Spend time with our VP of Engineering and get to know each other.\n* Meet the Team (2h) - At this point, the engineering leadership team is excited about you and you'll meet our CEO, Engineers, Product Managers, and some other folks on the team.\n\n\n I will be your main point of contact and prepare you for interviews. If we don\u2019t give an offer, we\u2019ll provide feedback!\n   \n\n  \n\n Technology Stack\n   \n\n  \n\n I\u2019m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don\u2019t require previous experience: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Benefits**\n* Competitive salary and equity.\n* 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby \u2014do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n* Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect \u201cVacation?\u201d in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it \ud83d\ude05.\n* Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n* $100\/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n\n Ashby\u2019s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We\u2019re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n   \n\n  \n\n*Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

Jecta AI is a Startdeliver company, backed by a proven team with deep experience in Customer Success and B2B SaaS.\n   \n\n  \n\n We\u2019re a high-ambition team with strong traction, customers in 10+ markets, and we\u2019re entering a critical scale-up phase. We\u2019re now looking for a Founder Associate to work directly with the CEO and help build the company across growth, customers, and operations.\n   \n\n  \n\n This role is for someone who wants full exposure to how an early-stage product-driven tech company is built - deeply involved in the product, the data, and how customers experience value through software - not from the sidelines, but by doing the work alongside the founder.\n   \n\n  \n\n**What This Role Really Is**\n The Founder Associate role is a generalist, high-trust, get-things-done role. It\u2019s not about observing, coordinating, or preparing decks - you are expected to own work and push things forward.\n   \n\n  \n\n Your focus will change over time depending on what matters most for the company.

From the very start we have been very clear about the fact that we are not building a solution for lawyers, we are building it with them, because it is the only way to make sure it gets done the right way; working side-by-side every step of the way.\n   \n\n  \n\n Our AI-native workspace empowers legal professionals not just to work faster - but to ask better questions, unlock new insights. Every day, we push the boundaries of legal tech to make complex processes smarter, faster, and more human. From thousands of documents analysed in minutes to intelligent workflows designed in collaboration with leading practices, we\u2019re turning possibility into reality.\n   \n\n  \n\n Today we are trusted by global firms like Cleary Gottlieb, Goodwin, Bird & Bird and Linklaters in over 40 countries, but we have no plans on stopping here. We ship fast, we iterate effectively, and we scale rapidly - not by accident, but by design.\n   \n\n  \n\n When you join Legora, you become part of a team that believes \"good enough\" isn\u2019t good enough and that the way to win is together, by empowering lawyers to do their best work with technology that truly understands them.

Ready to join us in building the intelligent future of law?**\n The Role\n   \n\n  \n\n As our Operations Solutions Lead, you will architect and operationalise the AI-enabled infrastructure that powers Legora\u2019s global scale. You will design and build the systems, automations, and processes that ensure we operate with precision, speed, and minimal overhead \u2014 creating an operational foundation that is robust, auditable, and built to scale seamlessly.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Your mandate is simple:** \n Build the most automated, AI-powered, operationally excellent organisation \u2014 empower our staff to do more with less.\n   \n\n  \n\n You will partner across Product, Engineering, GTM, and Legal to translate organisational complexity into elegant, scalable architectures and ensure that meaningful leverage comes from technology not people.\n   \n\n  \n\n What You\u2019ll Do\n   \n\n  \n\n Cross-Functional Operational Leadership\n   \n\n  \n\n* Collaborate closely with leaders, operational heads (IT, Revenue Operations, Product Operations, Chief of Staffs) and the business to ensure systems and processes align with priorities and scale efficiently.\n* Translate ambiguous operational needs into structured requirements, implementation roadmaps, and success metrics.\n* Establish operational rigor across initiatives, enabling predictability, repeatability, and high-quality execution.\n* Lead mission-critical projects end-to-end, balancing strategy with hands-on ownership.\n* Champion operational simplicity and discipline across the organisation, ensuring teams operate with clarity and leverage.\n* Serve as a key driver of operational simplicity, discipline, and efficiency across teams.\n\n\n AI-Enabled Systems & Software Implementation\n   \n\n  \n\n* Own and evolve the firm-wide operational tools that enable efficiency and scale.\n* Design systems that are automation-first and built for accuracy, resilience, compliance, and data integrity.\n* Implement robust governance, documentation, and lifecycle practices to ensure continuity and sustainable adoption.\n* Ensure tooling contributes to visibility, decision clarity, and measurable business impact.\n\n\n Integrations, Automation & Workflow Orchestration\n   \n\n  \n\n* Build and maintain the integrations that connect our operational stack end-to-end.\n* Identify bottlenecks, friction points, and manual workflows \u2014 and replace them with automated, AI-driven operations.\n* Partner with the organisation to design resilient, scalable workflows that support rapid growth and global operations.\n\n\n Process Design for a Lean, AI-First Organisation\n   \n\n  \n\n* Map, design, and optimise processes for speed, accuracy, and near-zero manual intervention.\n* Build workflows that self-diagnose through metrics, automated triggers, and monitoring frameworks.\n* Establish a data driven culture driven by dashboards, reporting structures, and KPI frameworks that enable decision-making discipline.\n* Ensure processes are robust, consistent, and capable of withstanding external evaluation.\n\n\n Who You Are\n   \n\n  \n\n You are deeply motivated by efficiency, leverage, and simplicity. You want to build an organisation where AI, automation, and great systems do the heavy lifting \u2014 not large teams, layers, or bureaucracy.\n   \n\n  \n\n You thrive in ambiguity, bring structure to chaos, and naturally turn messy workflows into elegant systems. You are hands-on, analytical, and operationally rigorous, with a bias for automation over coordination and tooling over headcount.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Most Importantly**\n You believe the future belongs to organisations that stay exceptionally lean \u2014 and you want to build one.\n   \n\n  \n\n What We\u2019re Looking For\n   \n\n  \n\n* 7-12+ years in operations, project management, systems management, solutions engineering, or process design in high-growth environments.\n* Proven experience implementing software, building integrations, and automating workflows at scale using modern tooling and event-driven patterns.\n* Strong technical fluency with the ability to design, deploy, and maintain event-based architectures in the cloud.\n* Analytical, structured, and detail-oriented \u2014 with a deep love for simplification.\n* Exceptional communication skills; able to align technical and non-technical stakeholders around outcomes.\n* Comfortable with fast-moving priorities and owning outcomes in a dynamic environment.\n* Experience with operational controls, quality standards, data governance, and building systems that withstand external review.\n\n\n Why This Role Matters\n   \n\n  \n\n This is a foundational role. The systems and processes you build will determine how we scale \u2014 not by adding people, but by adding capability. You will help create an organisation where AI is embedded in every workflow, where operations run with speed and precision, and where a small, exceptional team can achieve what typically takes hundreds.\n   \n\n  \n\n If we succeed, it will be because we built one of the most automated, AI-native operational engines in the world \u2014 and you will have been the architect behind it.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Legora is an Equal Opportunity Employer**\n At Legora, we believe great teams are built on diversity of thought and experience. We\u2019re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and committed to creating an inclusive, high-performance culture where everyone can do their best work.

We specialize in aeronautical technology and resource optimization for the global airline industry.\n  \nWith 19 years of experience, with operations in Mexico, USA and Canada, we operate as an extension of our clients' IT departments. We are entrusted with the configuration, development, and delivery of Jeppesen\u2019s Crew and Fleet Portfolio.\n  \nCarriers such as Aeromexico, Volaris, LATAM, Avianca and TAP Air Portugal rely on Optimen to solve their most complex operational challenges. We are now establishing a Center of Excellence in Sweden to lead critical implementation projects around the world, bridging the gap between client stakeholders and our engineering hubs.\n  \nThe Role\n  \nWe are recruiting a foundational team of Senior and Expert professionals (6\u201312+ years of experience) to lead the delivery of Jeppesen Crew Tracking solutions.\n  \nOperational Transformation through Technology This is more than an implementation role; it is a digital transformation initiative. You will help major airlines modernize their mission-critical operations by replacing legacy, manual processes with advanced optimization technology. Your mandate is to:\n  \n**Leverage Optimization:** Configure Jeppesen\u2019s powerful solvers to automate complex decision-making, shifting the client from reactive manual tracking to proactive, data-driven recovery.\n  \n**Engineer Efficiency:** Use technology to encode complex labor agreements (CLA) into automated logic, eliminating human error and unlocking tangible cost savings.\n  \n**Connect the Ecosystem:** Design robust integration architectures that break down data silos, ensuring the crew system acts as the intelligent digital backbone of the airline\u2019s operation.\n  \n  \n\nYou will work in a distributed Agile environment, acting as the primary link between European client stakeholders and our engineering teams in Americas.\n  \nCore Responsibilities\n  \n1. Agile Product Ownership & Value Realization\n  \n**Backlog Management:** You will own or heavily influence the product backlog. You must translate high-level business goals into well-defined User Stories and Acceptance Criteria for the engineering team.\n  \n**Focus on Business Outcome:** You will challenge the client\u2019s assumptions. Instead of simply implementing a rule, you will define the operational value (e.g., \"How does this configuration improve operational compliance?\", \"How does this automation reduce manual intervention?\", or \"Does this cost function accurately reflect disruption costs?\").\n  \n**Sprint Execution:** Participate in and facilitate Agile ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Reviews). You will be responsible for validating that the delivered increments meet the business objectives before they reach the client.\n  \n  \n\n2. Solution Design & Complexity Management\n  \n**Functional Modelling (CLA Rules):** Lead the definition of complex logic for Collective Labour Agreements (Union Contracts). You must be able to translate legal texts into functional specifications that determine legality, counters, and compensation.\n  \n**Tracking Optimization:** Configure and tune optimization strategies. You will adjust parameters to reflect operational priorities\u2014balancing strict efficiency against robustness during disruption scenarios.\n  \n**Architecture & Integration:** Design the end-to-end integration landscape. You will ensure the Crew Tracking solution communicates reliably with the airline\u2019s ecosystem (HR, Flight Ops, Payroll), defining Interface Control Documents (ICDs) and guiding data flow strategy.\n  \n  \n\n3. Collaborative Leadership\n  \n**Distributed Team Lead:** Act as the technical and functional anchor for our development teams in Americas. You will ensure requirements are understood, remove blockers, and maintain quality standards across the Atlantic.\n  \n**Stakeholder Advisory:** Guide VP-level stakeholders (Flight Ops, IT), SMEs, and Business Function Owners through complex trade-offs. You must be able to distinguish between \"must-have\" regulatory compliance and \"nice-to-have\" process preferences to protect the implementation scope.\n  \n  \n\nRequired Qualifications\n  \n**Experience:** More than 6 years of experience in software implementation, solution architecture, or technical business analysis within the aviation sector.\n  \n**Agile Mindset:** Proven experience working in Agile\/Scrum environments. You must be comfortable managing backlogs, writing user stories, and focusing on iterative value delivery rather than waterfall specifications.\n  \n**Airline Domain Mastery:** Deep understanding of Crew Management (Pairing, Rostering, Tracking) or Operations Control (OCC). You must understand the operational mechanics of counters, compensation logic, and disruption management.\n  \n**Consultative Approach:** You are not an order taker. You have a proven ability to guide clients through complex operational changes and focus on customer outcomes.\n  \n**Communication:** Fluent in English (written and verbal), with the ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical business leaders.\n  \n  \n\nPreferred Qualifications\n  \n**Jeppesen Ecosystem:** Prior experience with Jeppesen products (Crew Tracking, Carmen Systems legacy) or familiarity with the RAVE modeling language is a distinct advantage.\n  \n**Technical Stack:** For architecture-focused candidates, proficiency in Python, SQL, and AWS is highly valued.\n  \n**Optimization:** Familiarity with Operations Research concepts, solver tuning, or defining penalty\/cost functions for automated planning systems.\n  \n**Language Skills:** Fluency in Spanish is a strong asset to facilitate collaboration with our engineering centers in Latin America.","company_url":null,"company_url_direct":null,"company_addresses":null,"company_industry":null,"company_num_employees":null,"company_revenue":null,"company_description":null,"logo_photo_url":null,"banner_photo_url":null,"ceo_name":null,"ceo_photo_url":null},{"id":"849aa5c34e0c71c2","site":"indeed","job_url":"https:\/\/se.indeed.com\/viewjob?jk=849aa5c34e0c71c2","job_url_direct":"https:\/\/rpssoft.se\/jobs\/automotive-infotainment-test-engineer-manual-automated\/","title":"Automotive Infotainment Test Engineer (Manual \/ Automated)","company":"RPS Soft","location":"SE","job_type":"fulltime","date_posted":1770163200000,"interval":null,"min_amount":null,"max_amount":null,"currency":null,"is_remote":false,"emails":null,"description":"February 4, 2026\nFull Time\nSweden\nPosted 12 hours ago\nWe are hiring **Automotive Infotainment Test Engineer (Manual \/ Automated)**for the position based in **G\u00f6teborg, Sweden.**\n\n\n**Educational Qualification:** Bachelor\u2019s or Master\u2019s degree in **Computer Science, Electronics, Automotive Engineering**, or a related field.\n\n\n**Job Summary:**\n\n\n\nWe are looking for a skilled **Automotive Infotainment Test Engineer** to join our client\u2019s team in **G\u00f6teborg**.
