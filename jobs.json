And that is exactly what we do. We partner with industry leaders (and those about to be) to create excellent digital products that define markets, reshape industries, and deliver meaningful impact.\n\n\nBorn from the union of digital agencies Bontouch, Move, and Shape, Framna emerged from a strong, product-led culture. Today, over 600 of us collaborate across ten studios in Denmark, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the US.\n\n\nEvery day, millions of users around the world rely on the products we help shape. From seamless payments to daily commutes, from better health management to smarter shopping.

We call it Win by product.\n\n**What you get**\n----------------\n\n* **For us, it\u2019s office first.** Our cozy Stockholm office is our main location for work. Right in the middle of the city \u2013 a welcoming space where there\u2019s always something happening, whether it is a demo, a fika, or someone testing out a new idea. We spend time together to build culture, optimise for stronger collaboration, better products, and greater value for our partners and challenging ourselves while having fun doing it. We mix that with the freedom to work from home when it makes sense, and hours that flex around real life.\n* **A culture of curiosity.** On Fridays we have weekly demos, Wednesdays mean lunch-and-learns, and sometimes we throw ourselves into conceptathons just to see what happens. We gather for company conferences just to share ideas, and we take time to learn something new when needed.\n* **The freedom to follow your \u201cwhat if.\u201d** We believe the best roles are shaped by the people in them. If you are curious about something, you will have the trust and space to chase it, and probably a few teammates who want to jump in with you.\n* **Teammates who bring their whole selves.** Designers who doodle during standups, engineers who can\u2019t resist showing off a clever hack, product leads who keep the energy up when things get tricky. Around here, people genuinely like sharing what they know and celebrating when someone tries something new.\n* **And of course, the benefits you\u2019d expect.** A generous wellness grant, top-up on your parental leave, occupational pension, and plenty more to make life outside of work easier.\n\n**Our hiring process**\n----------------------\n\n* First interview with our recruiter, Josephine\n* Case assignment\n* Technical interview with two developers\n* Final meeting with our Head of iOS\n\n**Please note:** For this role, you need to be based in Sweden.

Since then, we have grown from a Swedish startup to become a pan-European mental healthtech organisation, helping people of all ages \u2013 from children to adults \u2013 across five markets.\n\n\nWe are on an exciting growth journey, building not just a workplace but a movement: making mental health accessible to more people, across borders and generations. Mindler is a place where you can help shape the future of mental healthcare \u2013 while growing together with us!\n\n**The role**\n\n\nAs our Growth Marketing Specialist, you will play a pivotal role in accelerating Mindler\u2019s international growth. You will own both traffic generation and web conversion, ensuring that ads and landing pages work together to create a seamless, data-driven user journey from first impression to booked appointment.\n\n\nReporting to the Head of Marketing and collaborating closely with Brand, Product, UX and Analytics, you will lead the development of a full-funnel approach that improves efficiency, lowers acquisition costs, and unlocks scalable multi-market growth.\n\n\nThis role blends strategic thinking with, even more importantly, hands-on execution. You will design, test, analyze, optimize, and continuously improve. It\u2019s an opportunity for someone who wants to take real ownership of the performance engine at one of Europe\u2019s most ambitious digital health companies.\n\n**What you\u2019ll be doing**\n\n* Manage, optimize, and scale paid campaigns across Google Ads, Meta, TikTok, and additional performance channels, mainly in Sweden and the UK.\n* Drive a holistic full-funnel strategy\u2014from ad creative to landing page optimization.\n* Connect platform spend with backend conversion data to determine true ROI and channel value.\n* Improve conversion rates by improving ad creatives, Quality score and landing pages.\n* Collaborate with Brand to iterate on ad creatives that maximize relevance and user engagement.\n* Partner with Product, Tech, and UX to together implement tests, tracking solutions, and scalable experiment frameworks.\n* Identify new channels, opportunities, and markets\u2014and scale them efficiently.\n* Build a structured, insights-driven experimentation culture.\n\n**Who you are**\n\n\nWe are looking for a doer with at least four years of hands-on performance marketing experience, managing budgets and driving measurable growth across multiple markets. You thrive at the intersection of marketing, data, technology, and user psychology, balancing the analytical mindset of a \u201cmath person\u201d with the intuition of a \u201cpsychology person\u201d who understands user behavior, friction, and conversion dynamics. Structured, hypothesis-driven work comes naturally for you, and clear communication across teams allows you to bridge marketing, Tech\/Dev, and Brand perspectives seamlessly.\n\n\nWe think you\u2019ll be a good fit if you:\n\n* Are hands-on, collaborative, and motivated by owning the full funnel, bringing traffic generation and website conversion together rather than treating them separately.\n* Thrive in environments that demand managing multi-market campaigns.\n* Use experiments and data to reduce CPA, improve landing pages, optimize Quality Scores, and drive scalable growth across markets.\n* Combine operational execution with analytical rigor, applying insights consistently to deliver measurable results.\n* Are energized by influencing high-traffic websites that help thousands of people access mental health support.\n\n**What we can offer**\n\n\nAt Mindler, you will work with high-traffic, high-impact websites across multiple markets and have a direct influence on how thousands of people access mental health support.\n\n\nYou will have the freedom to innovate, test, and drive measurable improvements\u2014supported by an established brand, strong cross-functional partners, and a mission-driven organization.\n\n\nWe offer a hybrid setup, flexibility, international collaboration, and a high-performing environment where creativity, experimentation, and growth are celebrated.

Because, when enterprises pivot to usage-based business models, they often make an unfortunate discovery. Their systems weren\u2019t built to handle the massive data volumes and complexity that usage-based models generate. This causes them to leak revenue and respond too slowly to customer demand. DigitalRoute solves this by creating a real-time usage data layer for enterprises. Our products transform raw usage data into clear information for billing, in real time and at high scale.\n  \n  \n\n**This is a hands-on support role with a clear destination:** Junior System Administrator within 6\u201312 months.\n  \n  \n\nYou'll be the go-to IT person for our Stockholm office while also helping colleagues across our global teams.

Provide L1\/L2 support, onsite and remote. Laptops, phones, docks, screens, printers, video conferencing. When something breaks, you fix it. When someone's locked out, you get them back in.\n  \nSet up new joiners. Run IT onboarding. Make sure new hires have working equipment and know how to use our tools from day one.\n  \nMaintain our systems. Help manage Entra ID\/AD, Intune, Kandji, and our asset inventory. Create documentation and knowledge base articles. Contribute to our AI support bot (yes, really, we're building one).\n  \nGrow into admin work.

Our platform - designed by clinicians, for clinicians - is built on deep insight into real-world pain points, with intuitive medical notes and workflows that truly support patient care.\n\n\nWe\u2019re a fast-scaling health-tech company backed by top investors and expanding globally. We move fast, stay curious, and believe building something that matters starts with an extraordinary team. If you're passionate about impact and innovation, we'd love to meet you!\n\n**About the Role**  \n\nYou care about data that actually works - data that\u2019s reliable, well-modeled, and trusted by the people who use it. In previous roles, you were the person who made pipelines stable, clarified messy data models, and helped teams move from \u201cwe think\u201d to \u201cwe know.\u201d\n\n\nYou enjoy building systems that quietly do their job, day after day. At Tandem, you\u2019ll bring that mindset to a fast-growing healthtech company building AI-powered tools for clinicians across Europe. As a Senior Data Engineer, you\u2019ll be responsible for designing and maintaining the data foundations that power our products, analytics, and decision-making.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll join a small but ambitious data team, working closely with product and engineering teams to ensure our data is accurate, accessible, and ready to scale, without sacrificing quality or trust.This is a role for someone who enjoys ownership, likes solving real-world data problems, and wants their work to have tangible impact in a highly meaningful domain.\n\n **What You\u2019ll Do**\n\n* Design, build, and maintain robust data pipelines that ingest, transform, and serve data across Tandem\u2019s systems.\n* Own and evolve our data models, ensuring they are clear, reliable, and easy to work with for analytics, product, and ML use cases.\n* Work closely with product and engineering teams to support data-driven features, reporting, and insights.\n* Ensure data quality through testing, monitoring, and clear ownership of datasets.\n* Help scale our data infrastructure to support increasing volume, complexity, and new markets.\n* Collaborate with engineering teams to ensure data is structured and accessible for training, evaluation, and production use.\n* Contribute to best practices around documentation, lineage, and governance, making data understandable and trustworthy.\n\n **What You Bring**\n\n* Strong experience as a Data Engineer working with production data systems in a modern tech environment.\n* Solid understanding of data modeling, ETL\/ELT pipelines, and analytical workflows.\n* Experience working with cloud data platforms (e.g. BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Databricks).\n* Experience with streaming or event-based data (e.g. Kafka, CDC pipelines).\n* Experience with data orchestration tools (Airflow, Argo Workflows, etc.)\n* Comfortable writing production-grade code (e.g. Python, SQL) and collaborating closely with software engineers.\n* A pragmatic mindset - you know when to optimize and when to keep things simple.\n* Strong communication skills and the ability to work across teams with different needs and levels of technical depth.\n* A genuine interest in building systems that are reliable, maintainable, and used by others.\n\n**Bonus Points**\n\n* Familiarity with analytics engineering tools (dbt or similar).\n* Experience working with data in regulated environments (healthcare, fintech, govtech).\n* Exposure to ML or AI data workflows, feature stores, or model monitoring.\n* Experience setting up data quality checks, observability, or governance frameworks.\n\n**Culture at Tandem**\n=====================\n\n  \n\nAt Tandem, we move fast, think big, and take ownership. We're a high-performing, diverse team with a shared drive to change the future of healthcare - and we\u2019re just getting started.\n\n\nOur culture is built on action, ambition, and learning.

As our game is distributed between game client, game server and the cloud, you'll work together with your team to figure out which parts of the problem to solve in which location. At Embark, we believe in creating smaller teams of well-aligned experts that can be trusted to keep thing running smoothly while exploring innovative solutions.\n\n\nSome of the technologies we currently use are Python, Go, GCP, Bazel, Terraform, Unreal and BigQuery. As a data backend engineer, your focus is to build services and tools that not only work well, but are also easy to maintain, extend and deploy.\n\n **Example of responsibilities**\n\n* Build new and optimize existing data pipeline.\n* Instrument backend services to collect data for new game features.\n* Build and maintain internal tools that present the gathered data back to game designers. This often means creating a dashboard using our custom dashboard framework, but we also have more bespoke tools such as a map viewer that allows replaying any match that has happened in the game!\n* Continuously improve our engineering practices and automate existing workflows to make sure our services are easy to deploy, scale and maintain.\n* Collaborate closely with other teams to build solutions that the players (and fellow game makers) love.\n* Improve and innovate on our telemetry and analytics pipeline with a focus on the backend services and applications.\n\n**We would love if you have**\n\n* A creative and curious mind.\n* A passion for interactive experiences, games and new technologies.\n* Experience working with DuckDB and BigQuery or other columnar databases with large data volumes.\n* A solid understanding about distributed systems and experience building them on a cloud infrastructure.\n* A good grasp of performance, optimization and observability.\n* Experience with some of the technologies we use such as Python, Go and GCP.\n* The ability to be a great team player with good communication skills.\n* Professional English communication skills.\n\n  \n\nAt Embark we offer competitive salaries, passionate colleagues to share knowledge with and much more, but most of all we invite you to take part of a journey into the unknown, to build creative, surprising and beautiful experiences together.  \n\n  \n\nWe welcome game makers of all sex, class, colour, age, gender identity, education, religion, opinion, culture, nation of origin, language, sexual orientation, shape, size, and ability.  \n\n  \n\nDid we leave anyone out? Well, we welcome you, too! We think that the gaming industry is made better when everyone has a seat at the table.  \n\n  \n\nBe yourself at Embark and make games while doing so.

From the very start we have been very clear about the fact that we are not building a solution for lawyers, we are building it with them, because it is the only way to make sure it gets done the right way; working side-by-side every step of the way.\n   \n\n  \n\n Our AI-native workspace empowers legal professionals not just to work faster - but to ask better questions, unlock new insights. Every day, we push the boundaries of legal tech to make complex processes smarter, faster, and more human. From thousands of documents analysed in minutes to intelligent workflows designed in collaboration with leading practices, we\u2019re turning possibility into reality.\n   \n\n  \n\n Today we are trusted by global firms like Cleary Gottlieb, Goodwin, Bird & Bird and Linklaters in over 40 countries, but we have no plans on stopping here. We ship fast, we iterate effectively, and we scale rapidly - not by accident, but by design.\n   \n\n  \n\n When you join Legora, you become part of a team that believes \"good enough\" isn\u2019t good enough and that the way to win is together, by empowering lawyers to do their best work with technology that truly understands them.

A central aspect of the subject field is a profound understanding on how different actors\u2014through their perspectives, roles, and capabilities\u2014shape and influence system changes, as well as how external factors drive development. Close collaboration with industry and other societal stakeholders is therefore a hallmark of the subject field.\n   \n\n  \n\n Duties\n   \n\n  \n\n The duties include both research and teaching. Research activities comprise conducting independent research, initiating new research directions, preparing research grant applications, establishing new research collaborations, and supervising students.\n   \n\n  \n\n The role also involves building, leading, and developing the research area of complex socio-technical systems at KTH. Research will largely be carried out in interdisciplinary projects, in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders. The professor will be part of a multidisciplinary group, thematically organized at KTH, with responsibility for broadly advancing the subject area in collaboration with groups in areas such as systems and component design, mechatronics and embedded systems, integrated product development, and design. The interdisciplinary character of the subject also entails extensive collaboration with other departments and schools at KTH, as well as with industry and the public sector.\n   \n\n  \n\n The duties further include contributing to, and actively working to develop, education at first, second, and third cycles. This also includes responsibility for courses and course development. The professor is expected to be able to teach in Swedish within five years. If necessary, a language development plan will be established as support at the time of appointment.\n   \n\n  \n\n Eligibility\n   \n\n  \n\n A person who has demonstrated both scientific and pedagogical expertise are eligible to be appointed as a professor.\n   \n\n  \n\n Assessment criteria\n   \n\n  \n\n The assessment criteria for appointment as a professor at KTH shall be the degree of expertise required as a qualification for employment. In addition, the assessment criteria stated in the KTH appointments procedure, section 1.1, apply in relation to the employment profile laid down.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Of\n *highest importance* \n is that the applicant has**\n* scientific expertise in the subject field.\n* documented experience of cooperation with the outside community for mutual exchange and having acted to ensure the knowledge and skills at the university benefit society.\n* pedagogical expertise in the subject field\n* expertise in promoting the development of, and leading, activities and staff.

You communicate clearly, bring structure to complex environments and know how to turn technological ambition into decisions organisations can act on.\n\n\nYou are comfortable moving between conversations with engineers, architects and business leaders, and you know how to create shared understanding without oversimplifying. We are looking for someone who contributes with experience, ownership and perspective from day one and who wants to continue growing their strategic influence over time.\n\n\nEnglish is required for this role. Swedish is not mandatory but is a strong advantage since many of our stakeholders operate in Swedish contexts.\n\n\n**What experiences you bring**\n\n* Experience in a technical or Management Consulting capacity, ideally supporting clients through technology-driven change\n* A strong interest in data, cloud and AI, paired with the ability to dive into both business-level challenges and the underlying technologies that enable effective solutions\n* Exceptional analytical and problem-solving abilities, with a structured approach to tackling complex issues\n* Excellent communication and presentation skills, enabling you to translate technical concepts into clear, compelling narratives for diverse stakeholders\n\n***Experience with any of the following is a bonus:***\n\n* Hands-on background as a Data Analyst, Data Engineer or similar applied technical role\n* Experience with LLMs, NLP, GenAI or developing AI strategies, weather in client-facing or internal innovation contexts\n* Knowledge of data management practices and data-driven transformation initiatives, including governance, quality or architecture\n* Familiarity with cloud technologies (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP) and how modern cloud platforms enable scalable, future-proof solutions\n\n**Curious to know more?** Have a look around our career site to explore our culture, people and way of working.

Every day, we push the boundaries of legal tech to make complex processes smarter, faster, and more human. From thousands of documents analysed in minutes to intelligent workflows designed in collaboration with leading practices, we\u2019re turning possibility into reality.\n   \n\n  \n\n Today we are trusted by global firms like Cleary Gottlieb, Goodwin, Bird & Bird and Linklaters in over 40 countries, but we have no plans on stopping here.
