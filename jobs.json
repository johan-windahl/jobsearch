We use AI as a sparring partner: to bounce ideas, bring new perspectives, support structure, and make our work more efficient. But the meaning, decisions, and interactions always come from people.\n   \n\n  \n\n* AI does not screen or decide on candidates.\n* There is no automated filtering, ranking, or decision-making in our recruitment process. Every application is reviewed by a person.\n* Hiring teams may use AI to support their work - for example, to structure notes, prepare interview questions, or organize their thinking.\n\n\n AI strengthens our work, but it does not define it. At Mentimeter, we\u2019re not building an AI-driven hiring process - we\u2019re building a people-first culture, where technology helps us listen, learn, and grow together.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Culture at Mentimeter**\n At Mentimeter we believe in giving everyone a voice - regardless of who you are. So we build a platform that does just that. Our platform is not only our product but also our organization. A platform where people feel safe, where differences are embraced, a place where you can have fun. We strongly encourage applicants who are people of color, LGBTQ+, women, people with disabilities, and\/or formerly incarcerated people, and a college degree is not strictly required. In order to give everyone a voice, we need to be as diverse as our users.\n   \n\n  \n\n Learn more about our culture by visiting our Culture page.\n   \n\n  \n\n Review our Privacy Policy for more information.","company_url":"https:\/\/se.linkedin.com\/company\/mentimeter","company_url_direct":null,"company_addresses":null,"company_industry":null,"company_num_employees":null,"company_revenue":null,"company_description":null,"logo_photo_url":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/v2\/D560BAQEUVjnirG3B-w\/company-logo_100_100\/B56ZUjdju7GQAQ-\/0\/1740056706530\/mentimeter_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=fy5ibQx-tPCWjidbNoyMsr3mQPtso9Fyxa7wPI1j4sQ","banner_photo_url":null,"ceo_name":null,"ceo_photo_url":null},{"id":"4343723843","site":"linkedin","job_url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/view\/4343723843","job_url_direct":"https:\/\/emp.jobylon.com\/jobs\/322683-postnord-group-business-controller-solna\/?utm_source=linkedin&urlHash=_RPE","title":"Business Controller, Solna","company":"PostNord","location":"Solna, Stockholm County, Sweden","job_type":"fulltime","date_posted":null,"interval":null,"min_amount":null,"max_amount":null,"currency":null,"is_remote":null,"emails":"emina.delkic@postnord.com","description":"Vill du vara med och skapa ekonomisk styrning som g\u00f6r skillnad i en av Nordens st\u00f6rsta logistikverksamheter?
