A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.\n   \n\n  \n\n To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform\u2014which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor\u2019s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.\n   \n\n  \n\n For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That\u2019s our promise to such a candidate.\n   \n\n  \n\n**A few examples of your responsibilities** \n* Help shape outstanding user experiences and impact the success of our products by creating flawless UI and UX designs, from conceptualization to delivery. You\u2019ll take a human-first approach to designing products, ensuring they delight users by being as effective as they are aesthetically pleasing.\n* Make use of prototyping tools to ensure your designs are intuitive and to explore new, innovative ways of designing interactions.\n* Work closely with product managers and software engineers to propose new features and improve the quality of both mobile and desktop apps.\n* Focus on user testing and research to ensure our customers are always at the core of our product designs.\n* Find, together with engineers, the most efficient trade-off between high-value solutions for users and the complexity of implementation.\n* Leverage usage data to evaluate the impact of your designs, and apply your learnings to the next iterations.\n\n\n**What we look for** \n* **Reasoning ability.** \n Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.\n* **Drive.** \n You\u2019re extremely ambitious in everything you do\u2014and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high\u2014and rising\u2014bar.\n* **Team spirit.** \n You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You\u2019re reliable, honest, and transparent.\n* **Proficiency in English.** \n You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.\n\n\n**What we offer** \n* **Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams.** \n You\u2019ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.\n* **An exceptional opportunity for growth.** \n We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential\u2014then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you\u2019ve got what it takes, you\u2019ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.\n* **Competitive pay and access to equity in the company.** \n Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of \u00a354,545 in the UK and \u20ac52,246 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between \u00a366,779 and \u00a3149,636 in the UK, and \u20ac63,965 and \u20ac143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.\n* **All. These. Benefits.** \n Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.\n\n\n**Commitment & contract**\n Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Location**\n Milan (Italy), London (UK) or remote.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Before you apply**\n Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We're extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don't hesitate to apply.\n   \n\n  \n\n**The selection process**\n If you pass our screening, we\u2019ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you\u2019re successful with those, we\u2019ll invite you to a series of interviews.\n   \n\n  \n\n Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested through this form.\n   \n\n  \n\n Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn\u2019t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.","company_url":"https:\/\/it.linkedin.com\/company\/bendingspoons","company_url_direct":null,"company_addresses":null,"company_num_employees":null,"company_revenue":null,"company_description":null,"logo_photo_url":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/v2\/D4D0BAQGftUJaAnPIxg\/company-logo_100_100\/company-logo_100_100\/0\/1688654635337\/bendingspoons_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Gabm76nmJkOQoKsqx_GPsqOVSFVhGDVVx--Pk6Y7LVk","banner_photo_url":null,"ceo_name":null,"ceo_photo_url":null},{"id":"4229264802","site":"linkedin","job_url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/view\/4229264802","job_url_direct":"https:\/\/foi.easycruit.com\/vacancy\/3504077\/12386&urlHash=Nbfc","title":"Senior grafisk designer","company":"FOI","location":"Kista, Stockholm County, Sweden","job_type":"fulltime","date_posted":null,"salary_source":null,"interval":null,"min_amount":null,"max_amount":null,"currency":null,"is_remote":null,"job_level":"mid-senior level","job_function":"Design, Art\/Creative, and Information Technology","company_industry":"Research Services","listing_type":null,"emails":null,"description":"\u00c4r du redo att spela en huvudroll n\u00e4r vi lyfter v\u00e5r grafiska kommunikation till n\u00e4sta niv\u00e5?
