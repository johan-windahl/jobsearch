The platform is built on an event driven architecture (some details can be found in this blog post). They should make it simple for customers to see and manage their resources, robust enough to scale, and boring enough that our support and infra team doesn\u2019t get 3 a.m. pages.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**What you\u2019ll work on** \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n* Design and evolve the Golang based Self-service API so that customers and internal teams have a clear, consistent way to work with compute, storage, backup, and container services. Our platform is event-driven, build on-top of NATS.\n* Lead the development of a (new) self\u2011service portal: from frontend architecture with Next.js and React to how it talks to the backend and external systems.\n* Make practical choices that balance \u201cnice engineering\u201d with what we can actually build and maintain as a small team, while still preparing for more users and more data.\n* Use and contribute to open\u2011source tools and libraries wherever it makes sense, and avoid reinventing things that the community already solved well.\n* Improve developer experience: testing, CI\/CD, observability, and documentation, so each engineer can ship safely and quickly.\n* Mentor and support teammates through design discussions, pairing, and thoughtful code reviews.\n* You will spend most of your time building and improving the product, not just coordinating work.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**Who we think might enjoy this?** \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n Working at a small company means living with ambiguity. Priorities shift, context is incomplete, and there is no neatly scoped ticket every morning handed in.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n If you like finding the real problem, owning it, and shipping solutions that last - you\u2019ll thrive here.\n \n\n\n\n If you prefer very narrow responsibilities or large, highly specialized teams, this may not be the right opportunity.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**What\u2019s in it for you?** \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n* A real chance to shape user-facing services that makes European tech autonomous!\n* Flexible, remote-friendly working conditions, with a possibility to work from the Stockholm office\n* Tech gear of your choice\n* Training opportunities to keep you growing\n* The stability of a collective bargaining agreement (or comparable benefits outside of Sweden)\n* Teammates who\u2019ll push you forward by questioning your solutions, contributing new perspectives, and exploring the tech rabbit holes that lead to better answers.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**Your team and ways of working** \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n Your team works on what customers touch first - the APIs and portal.

We meet for company offsites in May, and travel for tech conferences together (e.g. KubeCon or OpenInfra).\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n Some of the projects in our 2026 roadmap include:\n \n\n\n* Introducing an external API and golang SDK for our customers\n* Prototype a terraform provider for the external API\n* Introduce upgrade schedules for on-demand Kubernetes into our self-service portal\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**About Safespring** \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n Safespring isn\u2019t a typical cloud provider.
