We operate in a very challenging domain, with high data volume (billions of records annually), stringent correctness requirements, and complex business logic. To tackle these challenges, we have developed our own vertically integrated software stack, the culmination of more than a decade of research. It includes a bespoke database system based on a novel, patent-pending paradigm, an ambitious foundational ontology that models the real-world concepts and processes relevant to our customers, and a flexible frontend stack that lets us mix technologies like React, Vue, and Web Components seamlessly. Think of our platform as Minecraft for enterprise applications: a dynamic environment where functionality can be freely added, removed, and modified at runtime. We built this architecture in anticipation of AI, and now it's woven into every level: natural language querying, workflow automation, and real-time collaborative application development. We are no startup riding the latest hype cycle. We're a mature business making real revenue with real customers - Gek\u00e5s Ullared (the world's largest retail store), Telenor, Dollarstore, and Sportson counted among them. Our software powers everything from POS and e-commerce to purchasing and inventory management.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n Who are you?\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n You're smart and inquisitive, possessing both technical breadth and depth. You're a team player, but you expect excellence from your colleagues, as you do from yourself. While we think time is a poor measure of competency, you probably have a few years under your belt - whether those were spent coding games during recess in school, or grinding your teeth working on your PhD dissertation. You're no late adopter, but you judge new technologies on merit, not hype. Like it or not, you recognize that AI has fundamentally reshaped our field. But while AI agents have read Cracking the Coding Interview way more times than any of us, you possess a quality that they do not: the ability to think from first principles, striking the delicate balance between na\u00efvet\u00e9 and overengineering.\n \n\n\n\n What will you be doing?\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n We have no fixed tasks or areas of responsibility. Depending on your skill set and preference, you might find yourself developing new frontend components one day, and optimizing database index structures, debugging a crash in production, or adding functionality to our warehouse management module the next. AI is an essential part of your daily work. You spend a lot of time thinking about what gets built and why, but the majority of code isn't physically written by you anymore.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n What do we offer?\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n Competitive salary and the usual Swedish benefits: private health insurance, pension, 30 days vacation, and a 5,000 SEK annual wellness grant. We're small enough to be flexible. Feel like working from another country for a few weeks? Want a split keyboard, a 4K monitor, or an FPGA to test a hunch? Generally, the answer is yes. We have no procurement committees, no month-long approval processes. Conferences, courses, books, weird side experiments - if it makes you better, we're in.","company_url":"https:\/\/se.linkedin.com\/company\/heads-svenska-ab","company_url_direct":null,"company_addresses":null,"company_industry":null,"company_num_employees":null,"company_revenue":null,"company_description":null,"logo_photo_url":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/v2\/D4D0BAQFiOUjGa17IXQ\/company-logo_100_100\/company-logo_100_100\/0\/1683186683363\/heads_svenska_ab_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=4mSv4I8sE--o1mw9Ziu0aWJ_ROOFI2b-0ryE7rNuh6I","banner_photo_url":null,"ceo_name":null,"ceo_photo_url":null},{"id":"4350489518","site":"linkedin","job_url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/view\/4350489518","job_url_direct":null,"title":"Systemutvecklare inom Adobe Experience Cloud\/Campaign","company":"Folksam","location":"Stockholm, Stockholm County, Sweden","job_type":"fulltime","date_posted":null,"interval":null,"min_amount":null,"max_amount":null,"currency":null,"is_remote":null,"emails":"per.ruthstrom@folksam.se","description":"Vill du k\u00e4nna att ditt arbete betyder lite mer och att din uppgift \u00e4r viktig?\u00a0Vi letar efter dig som vill bidra till ett modernare, snabbare, mer aff\u00e4rsm\u00e4ssigt Folksam?
