It has previously been shown that using the perturbation design greatly boosts the quality of GRN inference on bulk data. The aim is to leverage this principle and develop new technology to unleash perturbation-based GRN inference for single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, to boost GRN quality and add the cell type and tissue heterogeneity dimensions to causal regulatory analysis. A deep learning framework will be developed with a specialized architecture to efficiently connect data with specific gene perturbations. A system for inferring the perturbation design based on gene expression and chromatin accessibility data will also be developed. The framework will be addapted and applied to spatial data to connect the GRN models to specific tissue phenotypes and to gain a better understanding of e.g. cancer development.\n   \n\n  \n\n Qualification requirements\n   \n\n  \n\n In order to be admitted to postgraduate education, the applicant must have the general and specific entry requirements.
