Our vision is a world without sizes, where every body fits. Our FitTech uses 3D scans and a one-of-a-kind, AI-powered recommendation engine to match everyone with the shoes that fit them best.\n   \n\n  \n\n With top brand and retail partners worldwide, including New Balance, Red Wing Shoes, Fleet Feet, The Athlete's Foot, Ecco, Intersport, Crocs, and XXL, our footprint spans 3000+ stores across 58 countries, and growing!\n   \n\n  \n\n**The Role**\n As a Technical Support Engineer, you will be the interface between our technology teams and our customers. In a normal day you will likely sit down with our engineering teams to help troubleshoot a hard problem, document a new best practice for your colleagues in first line support, and later in the day have a meeting with a customer's IT department to help them understand how their network should be configured for the scanner to work optimally. This is a customer facing role where you will talk to people all over the globe and learn new things every day!\n   \n\n  \n\n In this role you will be reporting to our Operations Team Lead.\n   \n\n  \n\n**What You\u2019ll Do**\n 2nd Line Support - Support our customers\n   \n\n  \n\n We have thousands of scanners all around the world. Every now and then one of them breaks and does not work. As a Customer Support Technician you would help the customer troubleshoot, identify and solve the problem and make their day! More than that, your actions should be guided by this question: if we identify a new problem, how can we make sure the customers will be able to solve it themselves in the future?\n   \n\n  \n\n Troubleshoot and bug hunt\n   \n\n  \n\n Sometimes issues can be harder to identify or solve, so we need to pull in other people within our organization. You will likely talk to our engineers, Product Owners and Key Account Managers on a daily basis to understand how a specific feature is supposed to work, why it\u2019s not working and what we need to do to make it work again. We work collaboratively at Volumental and during most days you will be interacting with different teams across the organization.\n   \n\n  \n\n Repair and restore 3D scanners\n   \n\n  \n\n Whenever a 3D scanner is returned to us from a customer, the unit will go through our Scanner Refurbishment Program where we either restore it to factory condition, or we take it apart to allow us to reuse parts for internal use. You will go through returned units, keep a log of quality deviances, and execute the needed repairs.\n   \n\n  \n\n Maintenance and proactive support\n   \n\n  \n\n A big part of supporting our customers is of course finding problems before they occur. As a Technical Support Engineer, you will help build out monitoring and maintenance tools to identify future problems and automate workflows, minimizing the time you and others spend on repetitive tasks so we can focus on what really matters!\n   \n\n  \n\n Logistics and Operations\n   \n\n  \n\n Ensuring our customers have fully functional scanners is a key part of our support process. You will coordinate the shipment of new scanners to customers, manage the replacement process for faulty units, and ensure spare parts are available when needed. This includes tracking inventory, working with shipping providers, and maintaining clear communication with customers to minimize downtime and keep their operations running smoothly.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Who You Are**\n* Love computers and humans alike- You are equally comfortable interfacing with computers and talking to people, whichever is required to solve the problem at hand.\n* A great communicator - You love to interact with people from all backgrounds, and can clearly communicate complex concepts in a simple way.\n* Patient and empathetic - You care about people and always have their best interest at heart. And you know that sometimes this requires extra patience and understanding.\n* Analytical and data driven - You can tell stories with data, dedicating efforts to use this data to back your arguments up or even confront them.\n\n\n**Qualifications**\n* Fluent in English - Other languages are a plus!\n* Good Knowledge of network types and different network environments.\n* Good knowledge of UNIX\/Linux based operating systems.\n* Working understanding, or experience, of working with Python and Bash.\n\n\n**You Have Previous Experience With**\n* Identifying the components of a consumer PC and explaining what they do.\n* Using Linux and not considering the command line arcane and scary.\n* Being familiar with concepts like IP, MAC-address, apt, ethernet, bash, python and being able to explain what they mean to a person that isn\u2019t.\n\n\n**Bonus!** \n**Don\u2019t let these stop you from applying, but please let us know if they fit you:**\n* Relevant experience in second line support with focus on Linux environments.\n* A passion for sports or previous experience in retail. We find that both help our agents to better understand our customers.\n\n\n At Volumental, we value innovation, collaboration, and a commitment to customer success.
