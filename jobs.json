We gather for company conferences just to share ideas, and we take time to learn something new when needed.\n* **The freedom to follow your \u201cwhat if.\u201d** \n We believe the best roles are shaped by the people in them. If you are curious about something, you will have the trust and space to chase it, and probably a few teammates who want to jump in with you.\n* **Teammates who bring their whole selves.** \n Designers who doodle during standups, engineers who can\u2019t resist showing off a clever hack, product leads who keep the energy up when things get tricky. Around here, people genuinely like sharing what they know and celebrating when someone tries something new.\n* **And of course, the benefits you\u2019d expect.** \n A generous wellness grant, top-up on your parental leave, occupational pension, and plenty more to make life outside of work easier.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**Our hiring process** \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n1.

We use AI as a sparring partner: to bounce ideas, bring new perspectives, support structure, and make our work more efficient. But the meaning, decisions, and interactions always come from people.\n   \n\n  \n\n* AI does not screen or decide on candidates.\n* There is no automated filtering, ranking, or decision-making in our recruitment process. Every application is reviewed by a person.\n* Hiring teams may use AI to support their work - for example, to structure notes, prepare interview questions, or organize their thinking.\n\n\n AI strengthens our work, but it does not define it. At Mentimeter, we\u2019re not building an AI-driven hiring process - we\u2019re building a people-first culture, where technology helps us listen, learn, and grow together.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Culture at Mentimeter**\n At Mentimeter we believe in giving everyone a voice - regardless of who you are.

We strongly encourage applicants who are people of color, LGBTQ+, women, people with disabilities, and\/or formerly incarcerated people, and a college degree is not strictly required. In order to give everyone a voice, we need to be as diverse as our users.\n   \n\n  \n\n Learn more about our culture by visiting our Culture page.\n   \n\n  \n\n Review our Privacy Policy for more information.","company_url":"https:\/\/se.linkedin.com\/company\/mentimeter","company_url_direct":null,"company_addresses":null,"company_industry":null,"company_num_employees":null,"company_revenue":null,"company_description":null,"logo_photo_url":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/v2\/D560BAQEUVjnirG3B-w\/company-logo_100_100\/B56ZUjdju7GQAQ-\/0\/1740056706530\/mentimeter_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=fy5ibQx-tPCWjidbNoyMsr3mQPtso9Fyxa7wPI1j4sQ","banner_photo_url":null,"ceo_name":null,"ceo_photo_url":null},{"id":"4326834575","site":"linkedin","job_url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/view\/4326834575","job_url_direct":null,"title":"Verbum s\u00f6ker Digital konceptutvecklare","company":"Verbum","location":"Stockholm, Stockholm County, Sweden","job_type":"fulltime","date_posted":null,"interval":null,"min_amount":null,"max_amount":null,"currency":null,"is_remote":null,"emails":null,"description":"**Om Verbum**\n Verbum \u00e4r ett f\u00f6rlag som ger ut b\u00f6cker och tidningar samt erbjuder digitala- och konsulterande tj\u00e4nster till f\u00f6rsamlingar i Svenska kyrkan.

Their mother was misled by a major bank - an injustice that inspired them to build something radically different. Fairlo was created to reimagine credit through transparency, flexibility, and respect.  \n\nToday, more than 40,000 people rely on Fairlo for responsible credit when life happens. With a 4.7 Trustpilot rating, exceptionally low churn, and a customer base that grows organically, we\u2019re proving that transparency and flexibility is not only the right thing to do - it\u2019s a winning model.\nWe\u2019re a tight, friendly team of 35 across Stockholm, the UK, and Crete, united by values of kindness, courage, collaboration and common sense. Backed by experienced investors and now taking the step to become a bank, we\u2019re entering the most ambitious stage of our journey yet.  \n\nAnd none of that is possible without world-class data foundations.### **The mission: why this role exists**\n\n\nThis is not a maintenance role.

You will be empowered to establish sustainable practices, dramatically improve data quality, and build the platform that enables analysts, product managers, and business leaders to self-serve with confidence.### **What you'll be responsible for**\n\n\nYour primary goal is to build a data platform that is scalable, trustworthy, and discoverable.* **Data Architecture & Modeling**: You will lead the architectural design and hands-on implementation of our new data model in Snowflake. You will refine and build clear, logical data layers, whilst resolving critical data model complexities.\n* **Data Governance & Operations**: Establish and enforce robust data governance practices from the ground up. Implement clear naming conventions, scalable role management, and a formal review process for all data engineering changes.\n* **Data Quality & Discoverability**: You will be responsible for making data discoverable. Implement a comprehensive data quality and testing framework within dbt, moving us to a state of high trust and reliability.\n\n### **What we're looking for**\n\n* **Proven Experience**: You have significant experience as a Data Engineer, with specific, hands-on success in designing and rebuilding a data warehouse\/platform from a complex or legacy state.\n* **Technical Expertise**:\n\n\n\t+ dbt: Expert-level proficiency. You live and breathe dbt, understand its best practices, and have used it to build and test complex data models.\n\t+ Snowflake: Deep knowledge of Snowflake architecture, data modeling best practices, and performance optimization.\n\t+ ELT & Orchestration: Experience with modern ELT tools (like Airbyte, Fivetran) and orchestration platforms.\n* **Governance Champion**: You have strong opinions, informed by experience, on data governance, data quality, and robust engineering practices.\n* **Strong Collaborator**: You have excellent communication skills and are comfortable setting requirements and collaborating with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\n\n### **Where you\u2019ll work:**\n\n\nPrimarily from our Stockholm office, with occasional travel to our locations in the UK, Greece, and soon additional markets as we continue to grow.  \n\nWe believe in the power of diverse backgrounds and perspectives - people who are driven by vision and ready to shape the future.  \n\nIf this sounds like the right place for you, we\u2019d love to hear from you.

Now we\u2019re scaling how we help customers realize that impact with precision, automation, and measurable success as the core, where NPS, customer sentiment, education quality, and advocacy are central metrics of success, not afterthoughts.\n   \n\n  \n\n AI first mindset\n   \n\n  \n\n We\u2019re not looking for someone who simply uses AI. We want someone who weaponizes it. You treat tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI copilots as force multipliers, allowing you to deliver at a level and speed others can\u2019t match. For you, AI isn\u2019t an add-on, it\u2019s the default operating system for how you think, work, and lead. You\u2019re relentlessly curious about new capabilities, and you push the limits of what\u2019s possible, turning AI into a competitive advantage for yourself, Upsales, and our customers. This is a role for someone with real ambition: someone who wants to set a new standard for efficiency, precision, service quality, and impact in the age of AI.\n   \n\n  \n\n What You\u2019ll Do\n   \n\n  \n\n You\u2019ll take full ownership of the customer success ecosystem: designing technical systems and experiences that are both scalable and human.\n   \n\n  \n\n* Build a world-class customer success infrastructure powered by data, automation, and AI, explicitly optimised to strengthen NPS, customer sentiment, and trust.\n* Redefine self-service with intelligent documentation, contextual help, and proactive support, ensuring customers always feel informed, empowered, and supported \u2014 key drivers of high NPS.\n* Design and deliver digital education programs, training, and scalable value-driven journeys that measurably increase customer confidence and satisfaction.\n* Integrate customer insights, feedback, reviews, and NPS data directly into product and AI models to drive smarter decision-making and deeper customer alignment.\n* Leverage analytics, telemetry, and feedback loops to continuously improve adoption, retention, and expansion, with NPS and qualitative satisfaction as primary indicators of success.\n* Lead and mentor the CS team to operate with precision, ownership, and technical depth, while instilling a culture obsessed with customer happiness, follow-through, and excellence.\n\n\n This is a role where systems thinking meets customer obsession. You\u2019ll be hands-on with tools, data, and workflows, shaping not just customer relationships, but the technology that powers them, always reinforcing a journey that increases satisfaction, produces positive reviews, and drives long-term loyalty. You\u2019ll collaborate with product, marketing, and support leaders to make sure our customer journey is both seamless and memorable, consistently strengthening NPS and overall customer delight. Together, you\u2019ll build one of the most effective and forward-thinking customer success organizations in the market.\n   \n\n  \n\n Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can reinvent how customer success is done\u2026 are the ones who actually do.\n   \n\n  \n\n Who We're Looking For\n   \n\n  \n\n* We\u2019re looking for someone who has already proven they can lead and scale customer success in a SaaS environment.\n* Experience with AI-enabled tools or analytics platforms, using them to enhance efficiency, prediction, personalization, and to identify the drivers behind high NPS and customer delight.\n* A systems builder: comfortable defining processes, mapping journeys, and translating complexity into clarity, always grounded in what creates happy, confident customers.\n* Equally fluent in strategy and execution, from designing scalable CS frameworks to implementing automation yourself.\n* You know how to connect customer voice with business strategy, turning insights into loyalty, advocacy, reviews, measurable improvements in NPS, and product innovation.\n* Personality-wise? You\u2019re a builder, a doer, and customer-obsessed.

We believe that new approaches, partnerships and technologies that support realizing children\u2019s rights are critical to improving their lives. The Office of Innovation is a creative, interactive, and agile team in UNICEF. We sit at a unique intersection, where an organization that works on huge global issues meets the start-up thinking, the technology, and the partners that turn this energy into scalable solutions.\n   \n\n  \n\n The Sustainable WASH Innovation Hub, based in Copenhagen, Denmark, aims to source, pilot and scale transformational and frontier climate resilient innovations that respond to key programmatic challenges that, if solved, will unlock faster progress for a water secure future for children and young people. One of the key global challenges that the Hub will address through exploration and scale of innovative solutions will be tackling foreseen climate change impacts on WASH services and delivery access. The Hub will also support research and innovation on the links between climate change and water, sanitation and hygiene.\n   \n\n  \n\n The Hub will bring together a passionate community of strategic partners including children and young people, academia, private entrepreneurs, public policy makers, social development and humanitarian actors, and our global UNICEF WASH \/ CEED and innovation colleagues in 150+ countries. Collectively we will co-create, advocate, enable, convene, and motivate for innovative sustainable solutions to long-standing barriers and emerging opportunities for a WASH secure and climate resilient future for every child.\n   \n\n  \n\n**How can you make a difference?**\n The role of the WASH Hub is to develop pathways to scale for solutions. Building on the MWML programme, the work moving forwards supports more Country offices to undertake Groundwater Exploration, and Mapping (GEMs) leveraging the methodology. The WASH Hub is looking for a consultant to outline the scaling pathway. This should be a structured approach that outlines the steps, strategies, and choices for expanding a proven innovation so it can reach a larger population and achieve sustainable impact over time.\n   \n\n  \n\n The pathway is not a single, fixed route but rather a sequence of stages and decisions that adapt to changing contexts and challenges as the innovation grows. The strategy will demonstrate success, summarise evidence, address local challenges, foster partnerships, enable policy, profile economics, replicate models, and iterate based on feedback to outline the approach to scale a proven solution as a robust, sustainable water resource management innovation.\n   \n\n  \n\n Specifically, for groundwater exploration and mapping, the strategy needs to:\n   \n\n  \n\n* Compile and analyze the More Water More Life (MWML) implementation experiences, methodology, tools, and outcomes from key countries (Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Angola, other countries can be included in discussion with the WASH hub team) to inform the next phase of the approach.\n+ Compile a methodological approach to identifying the mapping approach as the best practice in defined contexts, how to plan for and execute the mapping, funding and capacity needs, potential actors\/contractors to support the mapping and interpretation and identifying validation of results and success criteria for actual water delivery.\n+ Outline evidence gaps and future trends (the role of AI) that should be considered and addressed as part of scaling initiatives\n+ Develop criteria\/ guidance for selecting priority and pipeline countries for scaling that would be of added value for undertaking GEMs. This will be informed by a review of work in key demonstration countries to identify effectiveness in results and efficiency for delivery;\n+ Assess enabling environment needs for success such as policy and institutional readiness, compatibility in identified priority and pipeline countries for solution scaling.\n\n* Identify key lessons, gaps, challenges and opportunities related to groundwater resource development to inform the scaling strategy and evidence needs\n* Identify, assess and engage with key actors leading on groundwater development to map best practice, opportunities and common needs to support the approach\n* Unpack the various roles and responsibilities of different actors (government, partners, private sectors, academia financial institutions, UNICEF, etc, in scaling the solution\n* Propose institutional, technical, and financing mechanisms to operationalize sustainable groundwater development on a scale.\n* Provide a clear implementation roadmap and capacity development plan for governments and partners.\n* Identify what is needed in deployment kits and other resources to facilitate uptake and adoption into new contexts and countries.\n\n\n While this consultancy is intended for an individual to carry out, it will be informed by the WASH Hub technical team including a hydrogeologist and innovation specialists.\n   \n\n  \n\n*If you would like to know more about this position, please review the complete Job

We mix that with the freedom to work from home when it makes sense, and hours that flex around real life.\n* **A culture of curiosity.** \n On Fridays we have weekly demos, Wednesdays mean lunch-and-learns, and sometimes we throw ourselves into conceptathons just to see what happens. We gather for company conferences just to share ideas, and we take time to learn something new when needed.\n* **The freedom to follow your \u201cwhat if.\u201d** \n We believe the best roles are shaped by the people in them. If you are curious about something, you will have the trust and space to chase it, and probably a few teammates who want to jump in with you.\n* **Teammates who bring their whole selves.** \n Designers who doodle during standups, engineers who can\u2019t resist showing off a clever hack, product leads who keep the energy up when things get tricky. Around here, people genuinely like sharing what they know and celebrating when someone tries something new.\n* **And of course, the benefits you\u2019d expect.** \n A generous wellness grant, top-up on your parental leave, occupational pension, and plenty more to make life outside of work easier.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**Our hiring process** \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n1.

The department is among the largest of its type in Europe and has especially strong research profiles in psychiatric, cancer, reproductive, pediatric, pharmaco, genetic, and geriatric epidemiology, eating disorders, precision medicine, and biostatistics.\n   \n\n  \n\n Part of the success of our department is due to our collaborative spirit. Researchers at the department share and co-finance common resources (e.g., IT and an applied biostatistics group). Only researchers who are interested in this model should consider applying. The department is situated at campus Solna. Further information can be found at http:\/\/ki.se\/en\/meb\n   \n\n  \n\n**Description Of The Subject Area**\n Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events (including disease) in human populations. We apply this definition broadly and do not limit the field to what might traditionally be considered epidemiology. We welcome applications from researchers whose work fits within this wide scope, including research on epidemiological methods, regardless of whether the term epidemiology is explicitly used within their research field.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Your mission**\n The department is looking to recruit a world-class epidemiologist who is expected to stimulate and develop the department\u2019s activities within their research field. The focus of the position is research, and we assume that the successful candidate will continue their work within their established research field while also being interested in exploring new research opportunities. Supervision of doctoral students and some teaching in the department\u2019s undergraduate and\/or graduate education is expected. A key expectation of the position is to contribute to academic leadership and to engage actively in the development of epidemiology, of MEB as a department, and of Karolinska Institutet as a university. You are expected to contribute to the daily management work, both through physical presence at the workplace and through active and engaged participation in the academic dialogue. You are also expected to have the ambition and willingness to further develop your leadership skills and, over time, to assume greater leadership responsibilities within the department.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Eligibility Requirements**\n To be eligible for an employment as Professor with focus on research the applicant must have demonstrated very good pedagogical skills and excellent scientific skills.\n   \n\n  \n\n For employment as Professor at Karolinska Institutet, the eligibility requirements are stated in the Instructions regarding the Appointment Procedure and these are applied in relation to established profile of employment:\n   \n\n  \n\n See the instructions regarding the Appointment Procedure for Teachers at Karolinska Institutet.\n   \n\n  \n\n It is a requirement that you have completed 10 weeks of courses on teaching in higher education as indicated in the recommendations of the Association of Swedish Higher Education Institution. If you lack such education at the time of employment, you must undergo such education during the first two years of employment.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Assessment criteria**\n The Professorship has a focus on research. The assessment will weight qualifications as follows: scientific skills (3), pedagogical skills (1), leadership and collaboration skills (2).\n   \n\n  \n\n For employment as Professor at Karolinska Institutet, the assessment criteria are stated in the Instructions regarding the Appointment Procedure and these are applied in relation to established profile of employment:\n   \n\n  \n\n See the instructions regarding the Appointment Procedure for Teachers at Karolinska Institutet.\n   \n\n  \n\n Considerable emphasis in this recruitment is placed on personal qualities that promote a strong academic environment. We value leadership based on trust, attentiveness, understanding, and clear communication, where collaboration, empathy, and the willingness to grow together with colleagues and students are central values. The ability to build networks and drive collaboration, particularly within epidemiology, is of significant importance.\n   \n\n  \n\n After an overall assessment of the expertise and merits of the applicants in relation to the subject area, Karolinska Institutet will determine which of them has the best potential to contribute to a positive development of the activities at KI.\n   \n\n  \n\n**What do we offer?**\n A creative and inspiring environment with wide-ranging expertise and interests. Karolinska Institutet is one of the world's leading medical universities. Here, we conduct successful medical research and hold the largest range of medical education in Sweden. At KI, you get to meet researchers working with a wide range of specialisms and methods, giving you ample opportunity to exchange knowledge and experience with the various scientific fields within medicine and health. It is the crossover collaborations, which have pushed KI to where it is today, at the forefront of global research. Several of the people you meet in healthcare are educated at KI. A close relationship with the health care providers is important for creating groundbreaking top quality education and research. Karolinska Institutet is also a state university, which entitles you to several benefits through our collective agreement.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Location:** \n Solna\n   \n\n  \n\n**Application**\n Your application must contain the following documents in English: a cover letter as well as a resum\u00e9 and a qualifications portfolio including a description of your research plan, both presented in accordance with Karolinska Institutet\u2019s template (http:\/\/ki.se\/qualificationsportfolio). You may change or add to your application at any time up to and including the application deadline date. After the deadline, the process closes, and no amendment or addition can be made to your application.\n   \n\n  \n\n The applications will be reviewed by external reviewers, most often both national and international. For that reason, all the submitted documents should be written in English.\n   \n\n  \n\n The application is to be submitted through the Varbi recruitment system.\n   \n\n  \n\n We look forward to receiving your application!\n   \n\n  \n\n**Want to make a difference?

Our products combine a cross-platform student application (with full device lockdown) and a modern web platform for authoring, administering, and grading exams.\n   \n\n  \n\n As a QA Engineer you will own product quality end-to-end: break our apps in smart ways, explain exactly how you did it, and help engineers fix the right things fast, while thinking like both a student, an administrator and a red-team tester. This means you'll be collaborating daily with our product and support team about the products we build and support.\n   \n\n  \n\n**SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'LL GET TO DO**\n* Deep system-level testing for lockdown & exam flow on Windows and macOS, verifying group profiles\/policies, firewall\/network configurations, system hardening, logs, and exam workflows both online and offline\n* Configure and manage virtual machines and test environments to reproduce, isolate, and verify issues across different OS setups.\n* Create gold-standard repros: minimal steps, deterministic data, logs\/traces (OS + app), screen\/video captures, and environment diffs; file crisp issues developers love.\n* Web testing (UI + API): design and execute scenarios against our educator\/admin web apps; validate acceptance criteria, RBAC, and business rules; perform API checks in Postman and verify responses\/side-effects.\n* Threat-model and probe: think like a cheater\u2014attempt bypasses (keyboard shortcuts, windowing, screen capture, network tricks, MDM\/profile toggles, kiosk\/lock task escapes), and document risk & containment.\n* Automation where it pays off: contribute smoke\/regression suites (e.g., Playwright for web), build platform scripts\/tools for evidence collection, and add pragmatic CI checks.\n* Partner across teams: collaborate with Desktop (Rust\/Tauri), Backend (Go, gRPC), and Frontend (TypeScript\/React) to prioritize issues, tighten specs, and ship high-confidence releases.\n\n\n**What We Offer**\n You'll become a part of our international team of 20 colleagues.

We regularly implement and maintain efficient software tools that are essential for our verification process.\nYou enjoy sharing your knowledge and ideas with co-workers. You want to be part of a competent and creative team that loves to solve problems together, and we are sure that we are that team!\nBonus points for* Formal verification, including e.g. connectivity checking and formal property verification\n* Programming in Python, C, C++ or SystemC\n* Transaction Level Modeling (TLM)\n\n\nYour role  \n\nWe emphasize continuous knowledge\/experience growth for each team member and the team as a whole. Part of this requires continuously following new developments in ASIC verification since this field continues to develop rapidly. Work tasks may therefore include investigating new verification technologies or evaluating new tools. Depending on personal interest, there are opportunities to write papers and present at international conferences.\nOur verification environments are quite advanced. Developing and maintaining them requires a good understanding of digital hardware as well as software engineering principles. In particular, we make extensive use of object-oriented frameworks. Debugging and identifying potential problems in the hardware design is also a fundamental part of the job.\nOur in-house developed hardware often implements functions such as image processing, graphical transforms, and computer vision. As a verification engineer, you will have the opportunity to grow your knowledge related to such algorithms.\nWhat Axis has to offer\nWe are a world leader in network video, where cutting-edge technology meets global impact.
