Our core belief is that digital technology combined with great people will play a central role in delivering a step change in how boards and residents experience property management.\n   \n\n  \n\n What we do matters to billions of people across the world. Residential real estate is the world\u2019s largest asset class and buying a home is often the biggest investment a person or family will ever make. But the residential property management industry is lagging behind when it comes to customer focus and digitalization. That is why we formed Odevo.\n   \n\n  \n\n Leading property management companies in the Nordics, UK, Germany and US have already joined forces to form Odevo and over the last 4 years Odevo\u2019 s revenues have grown 40-fold to become a leading international player. Our ambition is to continue to grow rapidly organically and by attracting additional companies to join us in both existing and new markets.\n   \n\n  \n\n We deliver our property management services with custom developed software to simplify living and make life easier for property owners, association boards, residents and very importantly our own property management professionals.
