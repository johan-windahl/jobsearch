In 2023, we started as a startup called Leya in the basement of the biggest law firm in the Nordics. Through shared efforts, mutual growth, and true problem-solving, we built a product tailored to the needs of lawyers at the top firms. The spirit from those days remains.\n   \n\n  \n\n Today, Legora is the world\u2019s first truly collaborative AI for lawyers. The platform is embedded in thousands of lawyers' everyday life in nearly 20 countries by over 250 clients, and helps them work more efficiently, accurately, and devote more time to complex problem solving and high-impact, strategic work.\n   \n\n  \n\n With offices in New York, London and Stockholm, we are on a mission to empower exceptional lawyers by unleashing their expertise. Our team of product builders and lawyers ship fast and innovate - with our users and clients.\n   \n\n  \n\n That\u2019s where you come in...\n   \n\n  \n\n**What You\u2019ll Be Doing**\n Let\u2019s get the tricky part out of the way: this role doesn\u2019t fit neatly into a traditional box. It\u2019s part legal ops, part product specialist, part solutions architect, and part client whisperer. If you enjoy roles that stay static, this probably isn\u2019t it. Your mission is to help our clients, some of the most respected legal teams in the world, get the absolute most out of our platform.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Some Of What You\u2019ll Be Up To**\n* Acting as a thought partner to clients - building trusted relationships, addressing tricky pain points, and identifying high-value opportunities for them to scale their use of Legora.\n* Working together with Customer Success in taking full ownership of client relationship - from running pilots in the early stages, to onboarding new users, and ultimately guiding full-firm adoption across major law firms and corporate legal departments.\n* Be the voice of the user inside Legora - sharing insights that directly inform product development, roadmap priorities, and strategic direction.\n* Delivering clear, confident product demos and training that bring the power of our platform to life.\n* Documenting best practices, contribute to the development of scalable playbooks, and help shape how we grow this function globally.\n* Confidently helping our clients navigate one of the biggest shifts in how the legal business operates - from evaluating the ROI and impact of AI to clearly mapping how AI will impact different practice areas\n\n\n**What You Bring**\n You come from the world of law; but you\u2019ve never been content with how things have always been done. You may have started out at a top-tier law firm. Maybe you\u2019ve worked in a corporate legal team, seeing thorny operational problems from the inside. Perhaps you've even tried disrupting the status-quo through a legal tech company, or ventures of your own. Either way, you've had experience beyond the traditional legal career path. Either way, you know how legal teams think, work, and (sometimes) struggle and you're ready to help them level up with technology.\n   \n\n  \n\n**You\u2019ll Thrive In This Role If You**\n* Have a background in law, with experience at a top-tier firm or in-house legal team.\n* Are tech-curious and product-savvy. Not necessarily a coder, but passionate navigating technical conversations, especially around things like generative AI, technology implementation, innovation and productivity .\n* Communicate clearly and confidently with diverse stakeholders, both lawyers and engineers. I.e. translating across disciplines is second nature to you.\n* Bring structure to ambiguity and energy to complexity; and enjoy being the calm, credible presence in a fast-moving environment.\n* Understand how to evaluate and improve existing processes as a direct result of new and emerging technologies\n* Are proactive, self-directed, and comfortable juggling multiple client relationships at once.\n* Care deeply about quality, but don\u2019t get stuck in perfectionism - you get things done, and you make them better over time.\n\n\n**A few more things**\n We\u2019re a fast-growing company with bold ambitions, so you\u2019ll be joining at a time when things are moving quickly - in the best possible way. You\u2019ll have a lot of autonomy, a lot of responsibility, and the chance to genuinely shape how this (organisation) function evolves. Everyone here has a founder-mentality.\n   \n\n  \n\n If that sounds exciting rather than terrifying, we\u2019d love to hear from you.\n   \n\n  \n\n We founded Legora to empower lawyers with the tools they truly deserve. We\u2019re not building for the way law is practiced today - we\u2019re reimagining how it will be practiced tomorrow.","company_url":"https:\/\/se.linkedin.com\/company\/wearelegora","company_url_direct":null,"company_addresses":null,"company_num_employees":null,"company_revenue":null,"company_description":null,"logo_photo_url":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/v2\/D4D0BAQE8EzTbRO9NMw\/company-logo_100_100\/B4DZUeR_1kGkAQ-\/0\/1739969790386\/leyalaw_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=FJ_3tWyW4LZtW5y9OSIvHEEbFH674heKttRWNpbsrkw","banner_photo_url":null,"ceo_name":null,"ceo_photo_url":null},{"id":"4258072111","site":"linkedin","job_url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/view\/4258072111","job_url_direct":"https:\/\/jobs.wiseit.se\/jobs\/6059126-data-engineer-for-cary-group&urlHash=j-Yn","title":"Data Engineer for Cary Group","company":"Wise IT","location":"Stockholm, Stockholm County, Sweden","job_type":"fulltime","date_posted":null,"salary_source":null,"interval":null,"min_amount":null,"max_amount":null,"currency":null,"is_remote":null,"job_level":"mid-senior level","job_function":"Information Technology","company_industry":"Staffing and Recruiting","listing_type":null,"emails":"sandra.ahs@wiseit.se","description":"Are you a good Data Engineer with solid experience building data platforms the best way?\n   \n\n  \n\n Cary Group comes from a long tradition of entrepreneurial family businesses with a culture that cultivates entrepreneurship and is recognized for its sense of togetherness.\n   \n\n  \n\n We are looking for a Data Engineer to join Cary Group in Stockholm!\n   \n\n  \n\n**About The Job**\n In the role of Data Engineer at Cary Group, you will be involved in the continuous improvement of Cary Group's cloud data platform.
