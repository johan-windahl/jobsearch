The candidates are expected to engage in collaboration with external stakeholders in both research and teaching, tapping into our wide network of partner organizations.\n   \n\n  \n\n To summarize, we are looking for two junior colleagues with a passion for both research and teaching, who are doing outstanding research, have a track record of high-quality teaching, and come with excellent recommendations. Candidates should be prepared to contribute to our research environment, our education programs, and other areas in the life of a thriving academic institution.\n   \n\n  \n\n The expected start date for the positions is January 2026, but we are open to discussing alternative start dates. Salaries are competitive, commensurate with qualifications and experience, and are set on an individual basis. The tenure track period is 6 years, conditional on successful mid-term review after 3 years. Tenure evaluation takes place after a maximum of 6 years, and successful evaluation leads to conversion of the tenure-track position into a tenured Associate Professor position.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Requirements**\n The positions require a PhD within the social sciences or humanities, e.g. business administration, economics, (economic) geography, (economic) history, (economic) psychology, (economic) sociology, philosophy, political science, science and technology studies. Candidates must have completed their PhD prior to taking up the position and must demonstrate a strong research interest in markets and a commitment to high quality research and teaching in relevant areas. Experience from interdisciplinary research is a merit. Preference will be given to candidates who have published in top journals, have a proven track record of international peer-reviewed publications, and\/or a strong pipeline of submitted papers. Candidates should have an active presence in the international research community. Reviewing experience from relevant journals is a merit.\n   \n\n  \n\n The candidates should have documented experience from teaching relevant courses and must demonstrate teaching effectiveness as indicated by teaching evaluations, letters of recommendations and\/or peer reviews. Experience from teaching at both bachelor and master level, designing courses, coaching student projects, and teaching in executive education are considered merits. Ability to teach across core areas at SSE including the various management disciplines will also be valued.\n   \n\n  \n\n Finally, candidates should demonstrate an ability and willingness to undertake administrative duties and play a full part in the intellectual life of the department and school at large.\n   \n\n  \n\n**About The Center For Philosophies Of Markets**\n The Center for Philosophies of Markets at the Stockholm School of Economics is a newly formed interdisciplinary research center that draws on SSEs strong and broad research interest in markets. The Handelsbanken Chair in Philosophies of Markets is tied to the center, whose faculty currently (june 2025) consists of one full professor, two associate professors, one assistant professor, three postdocs and a center director. In addition there are four PhD students whose projects are linked to the center. The long-term ambition is that the center should comprise 8-10 researchers and 4-5 PhD students.\n   \n\n  \n\n The research agenda focuses on questioning and developing theoretical insights about markets, their workings and roles in society. This includes, among other things, understanding the theories and ideas that underpin markets and how these contribute to shape actual markets, studying processes of market formation and change, probing the workings of market societies, examining the growth imperative associated with contemporary markets, and exploring alternative market forms. The center is agnostic to the specific type of markets it studies and will pursue research projects across traditional product and service markets, consumer and producer markets, platform markets, healthcare markets, financial markets, labor markets, etc. The center is methodologically agnostic but has a clear focus on meso-level phenomena including individual markets and market systems.\n   \n\n  \n\n**About The Department Of Marketing And Strategy**\n The Department of Marketing and Strategy is one of six academic departments at the Stockholm School of Economics. The department currently consists of 10 full professors, 7 associate professors, 7 assistant professors, 3 lecturers, and 21 PhD students. The department contributes to teaching in the bachelor, master, PhD, MBA and executive education programs at SSE. The department also hosts about 30 affiliated researchers (funded by external research grants).\n   \n\n  \n\n Research at the department covers several disciplines including consumer marketing, strategic management and marketing, international business and marketing, business law, but also economic psychology, economic sociology, economic geography, and economic history. While this means that a variety of theoretical perspectives and research methods are employed, the faculty shares a high-performance research orientation and culture. Faculty members are expected to regularly publish in top journals within their respective fields. Our tenure evaluations reflect this and rely, among other things, on the AJG and FT50 lists as indicators of research quality. Besides publishing, our faculty members also actively and successfully apply for external research grants to fund both their own research and PhD and post doc projects.\n   \n\n  \n\n****How to apply****\n The formal application is made via the SSE Varbi online platform ( http:\/\/jobs.hhs.se\/job-vacancies ).

Today the company runs one of the world\u2019s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine\u2019s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World\u2019s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.\n\n\n\nWe realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that.

Today, our scope has broadened to include stewardship of CDNJS, the open source Managed Components project, and a range of strategic initiatives focused on empowering developers with more control over data privacy and analytics.\n\n\n\nAt our core, we\u2019re building new ways to help web application owners streamline development and accelerate growth on the Internet.\n\n\n\nWe are a tight-knit team, communicating & collaborating regularly.

We\u2019re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.\n\n\n**Project Galileo**: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare\u2019s enterprise customers-at no cost.\n\n\n**Athenian Project**: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.\n\n\n**1.1.1.1**: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here\u2019s the deal - we don\u2019t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.\n\n\n\nSound like something you\u2019d like to be a part of?

We are rapidly expanding the range of open source solutions we offer and deliver to customers, as we move into new industries like telco, finance, health care and media we design and develop new open source solutions to meet their needs.\n   \n\n  \n\n We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding engineers themselves. They should feel completely at home troubleshooting technical issues and having technical presales conversations with customers. They should contribute to project delivery themselves, but know that the technical contributions they bring are far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team's direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills and train engineers, who are interested in soft skills, to be managers.\n   \n\n  \n\n We believe that open source is just starting to transform the tech sector and enterprise compute.

Managers and team members also take part in presales conversations to provide technical advice during the sales process.\n   \n\n  \n\n A Cloud Field Engineering Manager is responsible for line management and career guidance. The ability to develop engineering talent, to represent your team from a technical perspective, and to drive collaboration with other teams and customers are all critical to success in this role.

We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.\n   \n\n  \n\n* Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person\n* Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year\n* Annual compensation review\n* Recognition rewards\n* Annual holiday leave\n* Maternity and paternity leave\n* Employee Assistance Programme\n* Opportunity to travel to new locations to meet colleagues from your team and others\n* Priority Pass for travel and travel upgrades for long haul company events\n\n\n**About Canonical**\n Canonical is a pioneering tech firm that is at the forefront of the global move to open source.

You sweat the details, but never let them block progress. You think in terms of speed, value, and iteration\u2014always asking: how can we get this in front of users faster?\n   \n\n  \n\n As one of our earliest engineers, you\u2019ll help shape the core product and infrastructure.
