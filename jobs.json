Every application is reviewed by a person.\n* Hiring teams may use AI to support their work - for example, to structure notes, prepare interview questions, or organize their thinking.\n\n\n AI strengthens our work, but it does not define it. At Mentimeter, we\u2019re not building an AI-driven hiring process - we\u2019re building a people-first culture, where technology helps us listen, learn, and grow together.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Culture at Mentimeter**\n At Mentimeter we believe in giving everyone a voice - regardless of who you are.

As we continue to evolve our platform and scale our operations, we\u2019re now looking for a hands-on DevOps Specialist with a background in development to join our growing tech team.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n**ABOUT US**\n\nMediaflow is a Swedish tech company with a user-first approach and a deep belief in clean design, automation and long-term thinking. Our platform is trusted by hundreds of organizations, from public institutions to global enterprises. Our headquarters is in Uppsala, while most of our tech and product development takes place in Gothenburg, where this role will also be based.\n\n\nWe are currently a DevOps team of three, working closely with one of the founders and the CTO. We combine daily engineering work with a long-term vision of building a modern and reliable infrastructure, and we\u2019re now looking for someone who can strengthen both perspectives.\n\n\n**THE ROLE**\n\nAs a DevOps Specialist at Mediaflow, you\u2019ll take an active role in designing and improving the tools and systems that run our platform, with an emphasis on infrastructure, observability and performance. Your expansive experience as a backend developer will come in handy, as you\u2019ll also help shape internal tooling, automation and system integration.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll work closely with product development and be part of a tight-knit, pragmatic team with a lot of autonomy. Our current stack includes Kubernetes, MySQL, and Ubuntu Linux, running on a mix of physical servers and cloud environments. You\u2019ll be involved in everything from daily operations to architecture decisions.\n\n\n**Examples of responsibilities:**\n\n* Operate and improve our Kubernetes clusters and Linux servers.\n* Maintain and monitor physical servers and network infrastructure.\n* Build and manage internal tools and services for the operations team.\n* Work with CI\/CD flows and backup systems.\n* Ensure reliability, performance and observability across systems.\n* Occasionally visit our datacenters (e.g. Falkenberg) when needed.\n* Collaborate with development teams to ensure infrastructure readiness.\n* Be open to future on-call models with compensation.\n\n**THE TEAM**\n\nYou\u2019ll join a small, focused DevOps team with high seniority and a collaborative culture. The team is distributed, but we aim to meet regularly at the office in Gothenburg. While fully remote work is not a requirement, we expect you to be available for on-site visits approximately once per month.  \n\n\n\n##### \n**Your qualifications**\n\n**Must-have:**\n\n* Strong experience with Linux system administration in production environments.\n* Deep understanding of Kubernetes and container orchestration.\n* Proficiency with network infrastructure and physical server hardware.\n* Solid programming background (e.g. Go, Python, Perl or backend development).\n* Comfort working with databases (e.g. MySQL) and data transport\/metrics.\n* Experience with CI\/CD pipelines and automation.\n* A pragmatic mindset and willingness to take ownership.\n* Good communication skills, English is the primary language used within the team.\n\nIt\u2019s a bonus if you also bring experience with infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform or Ansible, and a solid background in backend development, ideally with around five years of hands-on coding experience. Familiarity with observability tools and alerting systems is also valuable. A driver\u2019s license is useful, as occasional visits to our data centers may be needed. While a university degree is not required, we value proven, practical experience in the field.\n\n\n**BENEFITS**\n\n* High-impact role in a stable and growing product company.\n* Small, autonomous team with a modern tech stack.\n* Pragmatic working culture, structured where it adds value.\n* Hybrid setup with flexibility to work both on-site and remotely.\n* Office located in central Gothenburg.\n\n**CONTACT**\n\nThis recruitment is handled by our recruitment partner Detechtiv. For questions, please contact Axel at axel@detechtiv.se or 076-038 04 28.","company_url":"https:\/\/se.indeed.com\/cmp\/Mediaflow","company_url_direct":null,"company_addresses":null,"company_industry":null,"company_num_employees":null,"company_revenue":null,"company_description":null,"logo_photo_url":null,"banner_photo_url":null,"ceo_name":null,"ceo_photo_url":null},{"id":"4327989143","site":"linkedin","job_url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/view\/4327989143","job_url_direct":"https:\/\/karriar.skandia.se\/jobs\/6964499-azure-devops-specialist?utm_source=LinkedIn&urlHash=c4SK","title":"DevOps Engineer","company":"Skandia","location":"Stockholm, Stockholm County, Sweden","job_type":"fulltime","date_posted":null,"interval":null,"min_amount":null,"max_amount":null,"currency":null,"is_remote":null,"emails":"izabella.rolnik@skandia.se, harald.brehmer@skandia.se","description":"**Att jobba som Azure DevOps specialist**\n Som Azure DevOps Specialist kommer du att ha en viktig roll i att m\u00f6jligg\u00f6ra effektiva, s\u00e4kra och skalbara leveransfl\u00f6den inom v\u00e5ra utvecklingsplattformar.
