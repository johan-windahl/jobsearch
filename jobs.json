What does that mean exactly? It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that\u2019s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications \u2013 without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.","company_url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/salesforce","company_url_direct":null,"company_addresses":null,"company_industry":null,"company_num_employees":null,"company_revenue":null,"company_description":null,"logo_photo_url":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/v2\/C560BAQHZ9xYomLW7zg\/company-logo_100_100\/company-logo_100_100\/0\/1630658255326\/salesforce_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=qTOWgVlA05Oyq4_yQSi790-w_uu88NQ3SNcgh9xl738","banner_photo_url":null,"ceo_name":null,"ceo_photo_url":null},{"id":"4197058418","site":"linkedin","job_url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/view\/4197058418","job_url_direct":null,"title":"Konsult Microsoft Dynamics 365","company":"Sogeti","location":"Solna, Stockholm County, Sweden","job_type":"fulltime","date_posted":null,"interval":null,"min_amount":null,"max_amount":null,"currency":null,"is_remote":null,"emails":null,"description":"P\u00e5 Sogeti tror vi att det b\u00e4sta finns inom oss alla.
