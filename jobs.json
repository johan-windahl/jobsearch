This postdoc project, part of a Swedish national research project, is investigating how DevOps practices can be adapted to support safety critical systems and specifically\u00a0automated vehicles\u00a0(AVs). The need to update AVs is driven commercially and by evolving security threats but becomes especially important due to the open environments in which AVs operate. This requires monitoring actual operations and to be able to decide on and perform required updates, while ensuring that such updates and new behaviors do not jeopardize safety. The project addresses the gap between the tradition of DevOps, which is not addressing safety-critical systems, and the tradition of safety-critical systems, which does not address DevOps.\n \n\n\n\n The postdoc position represents a unique opportunity to do research on trustworthy DevOps for AVs. The postdoc is expected to contribute to collaborative research (including with other academic researchers and our industrial partners). There will also be excellent opportunities for experimental evaluation and case studies, something we believe is important. You are welcome to contribute to relevant educational efforts, especially in formulating and supervising project-related MSc thesis projects and supervision of involved PhD students.

Because, when enterprises pivot to usage-based business models, they often make an unfortunate discovery. Their systems weren\u2019t built to handle the massive data volumes and complexity that usage-based models generate. This causes them to leak revenue and respond too slowly to customer demand. DigitalRoute solves this by creating a real-time usage data layer for enterprises. Our products transform raw usage data into clear information for billing, in real time and at high scale.\n   \n\n  \n\n If you are a senior Software Engineer looking to take on new challenges, we'd love to hear from you.

You will learn, share, inspire, collaborate, and communicate actively with skilled and helpful colleagues in teams that are distributed globally.\n\n\n**What You'll Bring**\n* You have a proven experience with AWS, Azure, or GCP + Kubernetes and containers.\n* You have a proven experience with Databases (SQL\/NoSQL) with large volumes of data and transactions.\n* You have a proven experience with CI\/CD and containerization tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins.
