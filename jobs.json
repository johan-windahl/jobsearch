We mainly focus on developing headless Shopify and Sanity CMS solutions with React, Next.js, and Vercel.\n\n  \n\nHere's the gang on our team trip to Tuscany in 2025 - we're currently north of 20 people on the team (impossible to get everyone in a group photo!).\n\n### **Agency (Remote) Culture**\n\n **Friendly and transparent**\n\n\nWe strongly believe in open, direct, honest, and friendly communication. We show our clients genuine human warmth combined with skills and professionalism that demand authority.\n\n **Freedom + Responsibility**\n\n\nWe believe in autonomous teams and people who control their time and responsibilities. Less micro-management. Fewer project managers. More flexibility, responsibility, ownership, and accountability for our team members.\n\n **Integrated team**\n\n\nDespite our distance, we function as a \u201cnormal\u201d agency in many ways, with two weekly team meetings, weekly tech talks, bi-weekly 1:1s, yearly team trips, and more.\n\n **A business-minded approach to problem-solving**\n\n\nAll our team members should understand our client's business objectives and be mindful of how we spend their resources, ensuring they get the best ROI from our collaboration.\n\n### **The team**\n\n\nWe collect a rare combination of personality and skills and do not limit ourselves to the talent we find next door. Our team spans Norway (Oslo + Bergen), Croatia, Poland, Spain, the UK, Germany, Tenerife, Sweden, and Austria.\n\n### \n\n### **Flexible Work Arrangement**\n\n\nOur team members have a **flexible work relationship** with Represent that allows them to work as much or as little as they want. All our team members are **well compensated**, with a starting hourly rate equivalent to a full-time position in Norway (where it all began).\n\n### **How We Work**\n\n **Client \/ Project management**\n\n* Our \"leads\" meet every Monday to evaluate the previous week and plan the current week, including projects and team members.\n* We also meet every Friday for an hour to discuss client and project management topics, both to improve our ways of working\/managing, and as an opportunity to share\/learn\/grow.\n* Each lead manages 2-3 sizable project\/clients and typically a few smaller ones. All clients get a report from the lead every Monday.\n\n**Project work**\n\n* **Methodology:** We have an agile approach to projects and collaboration without following any specific framework to the letter.\n* **Meeting cadence:** Depending on the type and size of our projects and collaborations with clients, we typically have 15-minute stand-ups with the client 1-2 days a week and short daily syncs with the team. The frequency depends on what makes sense for the project at the time.\n* **Team size:** We usually have two developers on each project for a better dynamic and lower risk, working with 1-2 of our designers or the design team at one of our partner agencies.\n* **Project responsibilities:** Most developers on our team are responsible for one main project at a time and maintenance\/upgrades on a few other client projects.\n* **Variation:** We do our best to make your work life interesting and challenging and to adapt to your preference of sticking with long-term projects vs. joining in on something new.\n\n  \n\n**Software**\n\n* **Slack** for writing and talking with the team and clients.\n* **Notion** for docs, wikis, task management, project management, and more.\n* **Google** for video meetings, calendars, and email.\n* **Harvest** for time tracking.\n* **Figma** for design, brainstorming, data schemas, and more.\n\n  \n\n**Technology**\n\n\nWe mainly focus on the latest versions of:\n\n* React + Next.js\n* Tailwind CSS\n* Sanity CMS\n* Vercel hosting\n* Github\n\n  \n\n**AI**\n\n\nWe have an active community of AI enthusiasts that push the limits of how we can both increase our efficiency and deliver more valuable tools to our clients. Claude Code is one of our best friends, and we share knowledge about AI tools on a daily basis.\n\n\n### **Client Projects**\n\n\nWe prioritize long-term partnerships with our clients, designing and developing websites, webshops, and web applications with a *business-minded* approach to problem-solving.\n\n\nA few notable clients:\n\n* Vitamail - Headless ecommerce with Shopify, Sanity CMS, and React\/Next.js.\n* Apex Wheels - Complex headless ecommerce for Silicon Valley-based client with Sanity and Vue\/Nuxt.\n* Stay4Work - booking.com-like service for workers.\n* Empet - multi-site for veterinarian enterprise.\n* Current Value (Verdisatt) - Web application for valuation of stuff (like your grandma's ming vase) built with Sanity CMS, React\/Next.js and a custom Node.js backend.\n\n\nSee more clients and what they say about our collaboration.\n\n### **Benefits**\n\n **Stay focused on modern tech and fine-tune your expertise**\n\n* We exclusively develop headless web solutions using modern platforms and JavaScript frameworks, like React\/Next.js. We limit the number of different frameworks we focus on at any time so we can be the experts and not the average generalists.\n* We exclusively work with the top headless CMS (Sanity) and decline projects that require WordPress or other platforms that give you nightmares.\n\n  \n\n**Be part of an ambitious international team with a friendly, down-to-earth remote culture**\n\n* We have an open, direct, and friendly culture and communication style within the team and with our clients.\n* We combine genuine human warmth with skills and professionalism that demand authority.\n* We believe in autonomous teams and people who control their time and responsibilities.\n\n  \n\n**Enjoy freedom in the form of a two-way flexibility, where you can scale your work capacity up and down**\n\n* Want to work from the Canary Islands for a month? Enjoy! Want two months off for a sabbatical? Sure thing! Need some extra cash before your summer vacay? Feel free to work a little extra.\n\n  \n\n**Healthy compensation**\n\n* All our developers are well compensated, with an hourly rate ranging from \u20ac39 to \u20ac43.\n* The developer\/lead role (that you are applying to) has an hourly rate ranging from \u20ac50 to \u20ac60.\n* You control your work-life balance depending on what you value and what you need at any time.\n\n  \n\n**Co-create your ideal workplace**\n\n\nRepresent is a solid business with a startup mindset, and you'll take part in defining how we work and who we are as an agency. Exciting times indeed!\n\n **Yearly team trip**\n\n\nIn June 2023, we had an epic Thu\u2013Mon in Begur, Spain :\n\n\nAnd the answer is **YES**. Right before the barbecue transitioned to a dance party, the drone did end up falling into the pool for a wet death\n\n\nWe had an equally great time in 2024 on Mykonos island in Greece (not the sweaty clubs ):\n\n\nIn 2025, we took our adventure to Tuscany, Italy:\n\n### **Requirements**\n\n* Comfortable with handling clients and project management, as well as leading small development teams (typically two developers in our projects).\n* Eager to grow and learn more about management.\n* Ready for a long-term commitment (3 years +) working closely with the management in Represent.\n* Minimum 5 years of commercial experience as a frontend javascript developer.\n* Proficient in React\/Next.js.\n* You should be positive by nature, solution-oriented, and have excellent communication skills.\n* Fluent in written and spoken English.\n* Fluent in written and spoken Norwegian (Swedish can work out).\n* One last time for good luck: We prioritise excellent ***communication*** skills above all else.\n\n  \n\n**It's a plus if**\n\n* You have experience with Sanity CMS or (headless) Shopify.\n\n### **Communication**\n\n\nIt deserves its own heading. We say that \"communication is half the job\" of a developer. It's such an integrated part of all we do: writing and talking with your team, client meetings, video tutorials, commit messages, knowing when and how to ask for help, and even the code we write has an important role in communicating via its UX to those using the applications we write.\n\n\nHere's one great example of what we view as \"good communication\" at Represent:\n\n\nThe finesse is just beyond... **enthusiasm** like no other, **text formatting** to control focus, a **feature video walkthrough** for efficient and convenient reference now and in the future **ridiculous humour** that would put a smile on anyone's face, and last but not least **high quality of work** behind the scenes.\n\n\nPeter is an epic human being who has spent the last 14 years with Represent growing from a young freelance frontend developer to a full-time (super old) king of awesome who manages clients and projects like a true champion. Clap-clap\n\n\nHe's a great example of the people we want to attract and the culture we have at Represent. **Our culture is our secret sauce and a major reason clients partner with and stay with us.** We could hand our playbook to any other agency, but they couldn't copy what we do, because they're not *us*.\n\n### **Hiring Process**\n\n\nHere are the steps from reading this to working with Represent:\n\n\n\n* **Complete this form like a true champion:** Prove your communication skills and try not to rely on AI to sound awesome, because you need to be a better human than a machine ;)\n\n\n* **Introductory chat:** If your work from step 1 looks promising, agency manager \u00d8yvind will invite you to a 30-minute introductory chat to get to know you.\n\n\n* **Technical interview:** If \u00d8yvind finds you a solid cultural fit for the team, you move right on to the end boss, our CTO, Alexander. You'll spend an hour together, mainly focusing on a project you're proud of, presenting the UI and codebase.\n\n\n* **Trial:** We'll start working together to get a feel of our work dynamic, with a 2-week and 4-week checkpoint to evaluate how the collaboration is going.\n\n\n* If we're all happy: **Welcome to the team!**","company_url":"https:\/\/se.indeed.com\/cmp\/Represent","company_url_direct":"http:\/\/www.represent.com","company_addresses":"Los Angeles","company_industry":null,"company_num_employees":"11 to 50","company_revenue":"$1M to $5M (USD)","company_description":null,"logo_photo_url":null,"banner_photo_url":null,"ceo_name":null,"ceo_photo_url":null},{"id":"4321565442","site":"linkedin","job_url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/view\/4321565442","job_url_direct":"https:\/\/career.vntrs.se\/jobs\/6693818-praktikplats-digital-design&urlHash=ern9","title":"Praktikplats - Digital Design","company":"VNTRS","location":"Stockholm, Stockholm County, Sweden","job_type":"fulltime","date_posted":null,"interval":null,"min_amount":null,"max_amount":null,"currency":null,"is_remote":null,"emails":null,"description":"**Praktikplats inom Digital Design till VNTRS**\n \u00c4r du en framtida designstj\u00e4rna?
