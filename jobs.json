We have helped global regulators to become more sophisticated and data-driven in their AML\/CFT supervision and enforcement as well as supporting the delivery of transaction monitoring engines driven by next-generation technologies. By blending PA\u2019s rich history in consulting with our technology culture and capabilities, we mix disciplines, deliver faster, iterate smarter and constantly learn \u2014 challenging the status quo to seek the best solution for our clients.\n   \n\n  \n\n You will be working with our diverse and high performing delivery teams transforming FC risk management frameworks, crafting and implementing technologies across customer onboarding, payment screening and TM.

The Covid-19 economic relief measures unfortunately have attracted both criminals and legitimate claimants alike. The challenge now was for the bank to differentiate between legitimate applicants and fraudsters. PA was able to rapidly break down a seemingly insurmountable task and we solved the client's problem with limited resources. We identified high-risk customers, and they were investigated and reported \u2013 in some cases leading to seizure of funds and exit of customers. Strategies and tools built for this project were also used by the bank in other areas within financial crime investigations.\n   \n\n  \n\n For another large Nordic Bank, we helped merge country specific KYC policies into one global policy. The challenge was to ensure a policy that was standardized, detailed and specific, but yet allow for substantive differences between countries. This involved working with first line and compliance teams across multiple countries to develop agreed upon definitions, processes, and governance. The result was a streamlined and standardized set of policies that was useful and laid the foundation to standardize the KYC data set, processes and ultimately the technology.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Qualifications**\n**About You**\n We are looking for consultants with 2-3 years of experience from a similar consultancy or project work who want to be part of our Risk & Regulation team.
