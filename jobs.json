We need a Growth Architect who thinks like a founder\u2014someone who takes full ownership of the revenue engine, from the first ad click to the final retention loop.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**The Challenge (Your Ownership)** \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n You will inherit a working stack (Meta, Google Ads, HubSpot), but your mandate is to rebuild it for velocity and automation.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n* Master the \"Time-to-Value\": We look beyond simple signups. You will own the Activation journey, optimizing the funnel from the first touchpoint to \"First Task Created\" by removing friction and streamlining user onboarding.\n* Execute a Mobile-First Strategy: With a vast majority of our traffic coming from mobile, you will ensure our acquisition strategy creates a seamless transition into the App environment, maximizing conversion rates and user retention.\n* Architect the Automation Engine: You will replace manual processes with sophisticated, behavior-based nurture flows (PLG), ensuring that our user communication is triggered by intent and data.\n* Drive Marketplace Liquidity: You will balance the supply and demand of a 2-sided marketplace, utilizing advanced segmentation and RFM modeling to attract and retain high-value professional personas.\n* Stakeholder Management: Develop and maintain relationships with key stakeholders to ensure consistent growth for BuddyPro.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**Who You Are (The DNA)** \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n* You are a Builder, not a Manager. You don't wait for permission to fix a broken funnel. You don't need a ticket to scrape a lead list. You see a problem, you find the tool, you fix it.\n* You are \"T-Shaped\" & Technical. You are dangerous in Paid Media, but you are an expert in Product Analytics (Mixpanel\/GA4\/GTM). You don't need a developer to set up a conversion pixel.\n* You Value Impact > Activity. You understand that a full calendar means nothing if revenue didn't move. You ruthlessly cut \"busy work\" to focus on \"growth levers.\"\n* You Want Skin in the Game. You aren't looking for a 9-to-5. You are looking for a rocket ship where your contribution directly impacts the company's valuation\u2014and your own upside.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**Why Join Now?** \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n Most companies hire \"Growth Managers\" to sustain the status quo. We are hiring a Partner to break through the ceiling.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n* The Autonomy: You own the strategy.\n* The Team: You will work alongside a leadership team that values speed, data, and brutal honesty.\n* The Impact: Your work will directly define our trajectory in the Nordic market this year.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n This is a\u00a0Hybrid\u00a0role. You\u2019ll have the autonomy to work from home, but you should be able to commute to the office\u00a0in central.\n \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**To Apply:** \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n Do not send a generic cover letter. We want to see how you think.\n \n\n\n\n Send us one specific example of a \"Growth Loop\" or \"Activation Fix\" you engineered that directly impacted revenue. Show us the data.

Our 1.7 million registered users care deeply about realism, procedures, and getting the details right.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n We're a team of 50+, including software developers, UX and graphic designers, data analysts, content producers, motion designers, and support specialists. Navigraph was founded by Stephen O'Connell (CTO) and Magnus Axholt (CEO), both of whom are still active in the company. We've grown considerably but kept the collaborative, creative culture we started with.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**What makes us different** \n\n\n\n\n Navigraph is privately held, profitable, and built on the principle that people come first. That means prioritizing product quality and employee satisfaction. Our employee NPS is 80, placing us in the top percentile across industries.\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n The problem space is unusual: professional aviation complexity, consumer-grade usability expectations, and platforms spanning mobile, web, desktop, and in-simulator environments, including VR. You won't find this combination elsewhere.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**The role** \n\n\n\n\n Bring research, make the case, change the direction!\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n You'll play a key role in shaping the user experience across Navigraph's product suite, from our flagship Charts app to desktop utilities and in-simulator interfaces. The work centers on information-dense, timing-sensitive interfaces where clarity directly affects the user experience under cognitive load. The challenges include showing the right information at the right moment while making complex workflows feel intuitive.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n You\u2019ll lead the end-to-end UX process - framing complex problems, conducting research, validating ideas, and translating insights into intuitive solutions. You'll also contribute to our design system, ensuring consistency and scalability across products.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n You'll manage multiple UX initiatives across products and help build our user research infrastructure, including the behavioral analytics we're establishing across products.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**The team** \n\n\n\n\n You'd join the Charts Team within the Application Department as part of a small but growing design group. Design is embedded with engineering: same dailies, shared context, with dedicated time for UX-specific collaboration. You'd also participate in cross-department design councils, shaping how UX works across the company.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**The community** \n\n\n\n\n Our users are deeply engaged, active on forums and Discord, vocal about what they need, and genuinely invested in the product.

For a doctoral degree, the equivalent of four years of full-time doctoral education is required.*\n**The research group**\n The Department of Laboratory Medicine consists of seven divisions that conduct both research and teaching. The department is involved in advanced research, encompassing both basic and applied research. All divisions operate in close collaboration with clinicians at the Karolinska University Hospital. The Division of Biomolecular and Cellular Medicine (BCM) focuses on the use of modified biomolecules, cells, and cell products as new therapeutic agents, as well as the identification and study of suitable biomolecular and cellular targets for therapy and diagnostics. The division is also connected to the Karolinska ATMP Center.\n   \n\n  \n\n Our research efforts in the EL Andaloussi\u00b4s lab focus on one of the greatest challenges facing modern therapeutics; the delivery of macromolecules to target cells in vivo. Despite the unprecedented knowledge of diseases and their mechanisms due to advances in biomedical sciences; many promising therapeutic approaches are still clinically unavailable. This is simply because there is no efficient means of delivering these therapeutics to the right organ with the right dose. Our research performance involves developing novel and innovative drug delivery technologies that can carry proteins, RNAs, or gene editors to the target tissues safely and efficiently.\n   \n\n  \n\n One of the delivery modalities that we exploit is extracellular vesicles (EVs); natural nanoparticles that are able to convey genetic material from one cell to another. We have developed a range of genetic engineering strategies to modify EVs for the purpose of drug delivery. In addition to EVs, the Andaloussi lab also engineer LNPs and Antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates for extrahepatic delivery of RNA therapeutics.\n   \n\n  \n\n The future Ph.D. student would work on a project regarding the oligonucleotide bioconjugates and their delivery to specific tissues and in vitro and in vivo evaluations.\n   \n\n  \n\n**The doctoral student project and the duties of the doctoral student**\n We are seeking a highly motivated individual to join the group of Professor Samir El Andaloussi as a PhD student to work on the development of novel bioconjugates for therapeutic applications. The project will involve bioconjugation strategies as well as analytical and biological methods for conjugate characterization, including both in vitro and in vivo experiments.\n   \n\n  \n\n The successful candidate will be responsible for all aspects of laboratory work in the project and drive the project forward. He\/She will furthermore have many opportunities to develop their own projects within the framework of the larger project goals. In addition to the main supervisor Samir EL Andaloussi, the student will have two co-supervisors: Associate Prof. Malgorzata Honcharenko and dr Anna Rydzik (AstraZeneca). The successful candidate will take part in all research-related activities such as group meetings, departmental seminars, relevant international meetings, supervision of other students and researchers, if necessary, as well as contribute to common lab routines. Finally, the PhD student will work to fulfill the course requirements of the PhD program as outlined in the relevant rules and documentation available at the ki.se website.\n   \n\n  \n\n The position is a part of The Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie European Training Network ON-TRACT (OligoNucleotide Technologies for Rapid Advancement of Cancer Therapies), and the application to that position needs to be send to both Euraxess and KI.\n   \n\n  \n\n**What do we offer?**\n A creative and inspiring environment full of expertise and curiosity.

You may also gather evidence (parking session logs, license plate recognition data, geolocation) to represent the business in the dispute process.\n* Analyze Trends: You will dive deep into data to spot emerging trends specific to the parking industry, such as EVC fraud, QR code scams, reservations reseller fraud and other growing issues.\n* Cross-Functional Collaboration: You will work closely with the Product and Engineering teams to close security gaps in our mobile app and web portals, ensuring that fraud prevention doesn't add friction for legitimate parkers.\n* Reporting: You will generate weekly\/monthly reports on fraud loss rates, chargeback win rates, and false positive ratios to present to the leadership team.\n* Create, implement, maintain and update the risk-related policies and procedures to be followed by the company.\n* Review and ensure compliance is properly accounted for in the policies of other departments.\n* Evaluate current risk management strategies and make recommendations for change as the Card Scheme, Governmental, Banking and other relevant regulations change.\n* Work closely with management to ensure content is aligned with government regulations, revenue, customer, culture, and business objectives.\n\n\n**About You**\n A background in deep-dive data analysis combined with an understanding of the full card payment lifecycle, and modern fraud rules engines. Additionally, a sharp eye for patterns is key to outsmarting evolving fraud schemes.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Your Background**\n* Experience of compliance, merchant and\/or payment experience.\n* Experience of EMV payments.\n* Demonstrated analytical skills with experience supporting business case preparation and financial tracking.\n* Advanced knowledge of Card Scheme, Governmental, Banking and other relevant regulations rules and regulations.\n* Ability to design, review current design, document and update documented policies in a dynamic fast paced environment.\n* Strong understanding of the chargeback dispute process and chargeback flows.\n* Exceptional interpersonal skills and interactions with a wide range of levels across the business.\n\n\n Arrive, including brands like EasyPark, Flowbird, RingGo, ParkMobile and Parkopedia, is a leading global mobility platform.

The main responsibility is to take systems that work at current scale and redesign them to handle significantly larger volumes of data, users, and entities. The work is primarily architectural and system-level, addressing core bottlenecks and phasing out legacy implementations.

The department is involved in advanced basic scientific, clinical and epidemiological research. The department is one of the largest departments of education at Karolinska Institutet.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Division**\n The Department of Laboratory Medicine consists of seven divisions that conduct both research and teaching. The department is involved in advanced research, encompassing both basic and applied research. All divisions operate in close collaboration with clinicians at the Karolinska University Hospital. The Division of Biomolecular and Cellular Medicine (BCM) focuses on the use of modified biomolecules, cells, and cell products as new therapeutic agents, as well as the identification and study of suitable biomolecular and cellular targets for therapy and diagnostics. The division is also connected to the Karolinska ATMP Center.\n   \n\n  \n\n Our research efforts in the EL Andaloussi lab focus on one of the greatest challenges facing modern therapeutics; the delivery of macromolecules to target cells in vivo. Despite the unprecedented knowledge of diseases and their mechanisms due to advances in biomedical sciences; many promising therapeutic approaches are still clinically unavailable. This is simply because there is no efficient means of delivering these therapeutics to the right organ with the right dose. Our research performance involves developing novel and innovative drug delivery technologies that can carry proteins, RNAs, or gene editors to the target tissues safely and efficiently.\n   \n\n  \n\n One of the delivery modalities that we exploit is extracellular vesicles (EVs); natural nanoparticles that are able to convey genetic material from one cell to another. We have developed a range of genetic engineering strategies to modify EVs for the purpose of drug delivery. In addition to EVs, the EL Andaloussi lab also engineers various conjugates for extrahepatic delivery of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics. This is achieved either through bioconjugation of small molecular ligands or larger biologics such as nanobodies or antibodies. This project aims to develop novel bioconjugates for organ-targeted delivery of oligonucleotides and to uncover the molecular determinants of tissue and cell tropism.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Duties**\n As a postdoctoral researcher with scholarship, you will work closely with other team members to design and implement strategies for the targeted delivery of various oligonucleotide cargoes (e.g., ASOs, siRNAs). A central aspect of the role involves evaluating different targeting ligands and conjugation chemistries to develop RNA conjugates capable of reaching specific organs and tissues following in vivo delivery. You will also develop and optimize methods to assess the activity of these conjugates, examining how their physicochemical properties influence systemic distribution and performance. Ultimately, the rational design of conjugates will be correlated with their targeting and delivery efficiency in both in vitro and in vivo models using relevant cell systems and animal studies.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Entry Requirements**\n Postdoctoral scholarships may be established for foreign researchers who pursue their merit in Sweden. A foreign researcher is a person living in another country who comes to Sweden with the intention of only staying in Sweden for all or part of their postdoctoral education at KI. Persons who are resident in Sweden and\/or have carried out all or part of their academic education at KI or some other educational institution in Sweden cannot be considered for scholarships. The purpose of scholarships for postdoctoral qualification is to promote internationalization and contribute to research qualification after a doctorate or equivalent.\n   \n\n  \n\n A scholarship for carrying out postdoctoral research can be granted for a maximum of two years within a four-year period following the receipt of a doctoral degree or equivalent.\n   \n\n  \n\n To be eligible for a postdoctoral scholarship, the person must have obtained a doctorate, or a foreign degree deemed to be equivalent to a doctorate. Applicants who have not completed a doctorate at the end of the application period may also apply, provided that all requirements for a completed degree are met before the (intended) start date of the post-doctoral education.\n   \n\n  \n\n We are seeking a highly motivated scientist with a strong background in oligonucleotide conjugate delivery and in vivo biodistribution studies.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Key areas of expertise:**\n**In vitro characterization**\n* Develop and implement methods to characterize the physicochemical properties of oligonucleotide conjugates.\n* Utilize in vitro screening models to assess potency and delivery efficiency of oligonucleotide conjugates.\n\n\n**Preferred but not required:**\n* Investigate mechanisms of intracellular uptake and endosomal escape, including development of novel analytical methods.\n\n\n**Laboratory animal science**\n* Extensive hands-on experience in mouse handling, including administration routes (e.g., IV, IP) and surgical procedures relevant to delivery studies.\n* Strong understanding of ethics, approved procedures, and animal welfare; meticulous record-keeping and regulatory compliance.\n* Proven track record in evaluating biodistribution of oligonucleotide-based modalities in mouse models.\n* Preferred but not required: Experience with toxicity studies and in vivo imaging (e.g., IVIS, bioluminescence, fluorescence).\n\n\n**Molecular and cellular biology expertise:**\n* Proficiency in mammalian cell culture and transient transfections.\n* Expertise in quantitative assays to evaluate the outcome of in vitro and in vivo studies related to oligonucleotide delivery, such as gene expression analysis (RT-qPCR) or oligonucleotide detection methods (e.g., dPCR, SplintR).\n* Preferred but not required: Experience with flow cytometry for tissue\/cell uptake analysis, single-cell sorting, and RNA sequencing.\n\n\n In addition, excellent proficiency in both spoken and written English is essential. We are looking for an energetic and passionate individual who actively contributes to our team and thrives in a collaborative environment. Strong interpersonal and communication skills are required, along with the ability to work independently and manage multiple tasks. Meticulous attention to detail, excellent documentation practices, and a proactive approach to troubleshooting are highly valued.\n   \n\n  \n\n**What do we offer?**\n A creative and inspiring environment with wide-ranging expertise and interests. Karolinska Institutet is one of the world's leading medical universities. Here, we conduct innovative medical research and provide the largest range of biomedical education in Sweden. At KI, you get to meet researchers working with a wide range of specialisms and methods, giving you ample opportunity to exchange knowledge and experience with the various scientific fields within medicine and health. It is the crossover collaborations, which have pushed KI to where it is today, at the forefront of global research. Several of the people you meet in healthcare are educated at KI. A close relationship with the health care providers is important for creating groundbreaking top quality education and research. Students and employees have free access to our modern gym facilities with trained staff on site.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Location:** \n Flemingsberg\n   \n\n  \n\n**Type of scholarship**\n The amount is tax free and it is set for twelve months at a time, paid out on a six months basis. In exceptional cases, shorter periods may be acceptable.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Application process**\n An application must contain the following documents in English or Swedish:\n   \n\n  \n\n* A complete curriculum vitae, including date of the thesis defence, title of the thesis, previous academic positions, academic title, current position, academic distinctions, and committee work\n* A complete list of publications\n* A summary of current work (no more than one page)\n\n\n The application is to be submitted on the Varbi recruitment system.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Want to make a difference?
