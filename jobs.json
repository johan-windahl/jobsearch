Our story began in 2005, when two lifelong friends and entrepreneurs, driven by their passion for travel, launched Agoda to make it easier for everyone to explore the world.\n   \n\n  \n\n Today, we are part of Booking Holdings [NASDAQ: BKNG], with a diverse team of over 7,000 people from 90 countries, working together in offices around the globe. Every day, we connect people to destinations and experiences, with our great deals across our millions of hotels and holiday properties, flights, and experiences worldwide.\n   \n\n  \n\n No two days are the same at Agoda. Data and technology are at the heart of our culture, fueling our curiosity and innovation. If you\u2019re ready to begin your best journey and help build travel for the world, join us.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Get to Know Our Design Team:**\n The Design team is a diverse group of product designers and researchers that help to build Agoda\u2019s products from our home office in Bangkok. Being a product-driven company, we constantly partner with product managers and engineers to understand user problems and design workflows, interactions, and visual interfaces.\n   \n\n  \n\n There is always an opportunity for growth here. Focus on your craft to improve or expand your skill set, or step into a managerial role and flex your talents as a designer and driver of team projects. This is a great time to join a team that\u2019s small enough to be scrappy and hands on, yet big enough to influence change and product strategy.\n   \n\n  \n\n At Agoda, we offer a range of travel products \u2013 including accommodations, flights, and activities \u2013 and are building the next generation of travel experiences to help customers plan and book their entire trip.

In this role, you\u2019ll drive design strategy, collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, and ensure our flight products set the benchmark for usability and innovation in the online travel industry.\n   \n\n  \n\n In your day-to-day work, you\u2019ll turn strategy into actionable design solutions by setting design direction, solving complex challenges, and delivering experiences that are intuitive, scalable, and grounded in user insights. You\u2019ll champion user needs throughout the product lifecycle, using research and data to continuously refine our flight offerings.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Experience Requirements & Role Expectations:**\n* 6+ years of full-time experience as a product designer for digital or web-based products; in-house experience highly preferred.\n* Create visually stunning, intuitive, and delightful interfaces, and independently deliver pixel-perfect UI and seamless interactions. You sweat the details and care deeply about craft.\n* You are highly experienced in UI design, with deep knowledge of design patterns and a creative approach to solving problems through user interfaces.\n* Proficient in both quantitative and qualitative research, with hands-on experience running user interviews, synthesizing findings, and generating actionable insights to inform design decisions.\n* Take full ownership of the design process for a dedicated scrum, from discovery to delivery. You\u2019ll set the design vision, define the user experience, and ensure high-quality execution.\n* Partner with Product managers to shape product vision and roadmap.
