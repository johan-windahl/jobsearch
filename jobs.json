The equity\n   \n\n  \n\n strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children\u2019s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life \u2014 in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions \u2014 her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society\u2019s most disadvantaged citizens \u2014 addressing inequity \u2014 not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.\n   \n\n  \n\n The UNICEF Venture Fund has been specifically designed to finance early stage, open-source technology that can benefit children.

We also work with VCs, PEs and Funds with their portfolio companies as well as family businesses. Typically, this takes the form of working within each business between 1-10 days a month.\n   \n\n  \n\n Our approach is to provide the highest quality Board Advisor skill set, with a strong emphasis on strategic and commercial skills, and to pro-actively engage with business owners to deliver terrific value.\n   \n\n  \n\n We are sector agnostic and provide Director-level expert skills in finance, marketing, sales, IT, HR and Managing. We also supply Non-Executive Directors, Chairs, Mentors and Coaches.\n   \n\n  \n\n**What are the benefits?**\n Here are some benefits of a Master License arrangement for a licensee of Boardroom Advisors:\n   \n\n  \n\n* Reduced Risk: One of the primary benefits of a master license arrangement for a licensee is reduced risk. The licensee can leverage Boardroom Advisors\u2019 brand reputation, established systems and processes, and marketing support to enter a new market with confidence. This can significantly reduce the risk of failure and financial loss.\n* Access to established systems and processes: Another benefit is access to established systems and processes. The licensee can benefit from Boardroom Advisors\u2019 proven business model, operational procedures, and best practices. This can help the licensee to avoid common mistakes and pitfalls and to operate more efficiently.\n* Access to Intellectual Property: The licensee can gain access to Boardroom Advisors\u2019 intellectual property, including trademarks and proprietary technologies. This can give the licensee a competitive advantage in the market and enable the development of new products and services.\n* Training and Support: The licensee can receive training and ongoing support from Boardroom Advisors in various areas such as product knowledge, marketing and sales, and customer service. This can help the licensee to develop their own business skills and to provide better service to their customers.\n* Brand Recognition: The licensee can leverage Boardroom Advisors\u2019 established brand recognition to build their own brand in the market. This can help to attract new clients, Advisors and Regional Directors.\n* Exclusive Territory: The licensee can operate exclusively within a specific territory or market segment. This can reduce competition and enable the licensee to establish themselves as the leading provider in that area.\n* Reduced Investment: The licensee can benefit from reduced investment in research and development, marketing, and other areas as Boardroom Advisors may have already invested in these areas. This can help to lower costs and improve profitability.\n\n\n**Who joins Boardroom Advisors?**\n All our Advisors \u201chave been there, seen it and done it\u201d. They are predominantly well\n   \n\n  \n\n qualified, all have scaled businesses, been real life Managing Directors or CEOs in business, and all our Advisors get a real buzz out of our clients\u2019 success.\n   \n\n  \n\n**To Join Boardroom Advisors, You Will Need To**\n I. Share our values. We believe that successful businesses not only need outstanding\n   \n\n  \n\n commercial skills but require a strong and aligned culture in which to thrive. We are\n   \n\n  \n\n proud of our culture. Prospects, businesses owners, suppliers and our team tell us that\n   \n\n  \n\n we are refreshingly different. Our three core values \u201ctransparency, energy and\n   \n\n  \n\n teamwork\u201d provide the foundation on which the culture is built. We seek individuals\n   \n\n  \n\n that are aligned with our culture and values.\n   \n\n  \n\n II. Demonstrate that you have a strong empathy towards entrepreneurs in the Scale-Up\n   \n\n  \n\n marketplace as well as VCs, PEs and Fund portfolio companies as well as family businesses. And a strong desire to engage with entrepreneurs and investors to create a position as the \u201ctrusted advisor of choice\u201d. We require team members who can work with businesses over the long term with a laser focus on excellent customer service.\n   \n\n  \n\n III. Have the ability to fund yourself outside of joining our team. We are non-exclusive, no\n   \n\n  \n\n cost and no obligation. It will take time to build your Regional Director and Advisor business base, this could take months before earnings start to flow.\n   \n\n  \n\n IV. Team energy. We require individuals who can put all their energies into being part of\n   \n\n  \n\n our team. A key aspect of this is business development, and you will be expected to\n   \n\n  \n\n actively participate in helping to generate new leads for you and your team.\n   \n\n  \n\n**What is the arrangement for Master Licensees?**\n Master Licensees have exclusive territorial rights to using the Boardroom Advisors brand, web site, case studies, business model, marketing systems, processes etc for a period of years. We provide initial induction, training and ongoing support starting with weekly meetings and phasing over to monthly Board Meetings over time where we provide strategic help and advice.\n   \n\n  \n\n In exchange for helping to get the business up and running, we ask for a small initial commitment fee, a 10% royalty and a 10% shareholding in the licensee company. This ensures long-term commitment from the \u201cparent\u201d company in the success of the licensee.\n   \n\n  \n\n**How do you deliver your services to a business?**\n Following the initial meeting with a prospect business by a Regional Director,\n   \n\n  \n\n Boardroom Advisors introduces the appropriate Advisor to the business owner and ascertains the objectives and anticipated outcomes.\n   \n\n  \n\n Work is on an agreed package or number of days per month; or occasionally the delivery is an initial project with the opportunity to develop into a package or on-going days per month engagement.\n   \n\n  \n\n For each business there is a lead Advisor and a Regional Director. This team approach helps foster a stronger B2B relationship and business loyalty.\n   \n\n  \n\n**What type of work does Boardroom Advisors undertake?**\n Our work covers all aspects of a Board Advisor role in a successful business. Our aim is to\n   \n\n  \n\n establish long-term involvement with a business, generating regular income streams, rather\n   \n\n  \n\n than work on projects. Engagements are extremely varied and dependent upon the business\n   \n\n  \n\n needs and the stage of development the company has reached. Some examples of work the\n   \n\n  \n\n client has as a \u201ctrigger\u201d to dealing with us and we might undertake as part of the\n   \n\n  \n\n**Appointment As Advisor Include**\n* Strategy development\n* Performance review\n* Systems development\n* Funding analysis\n* Outsourcing and supplier analysis\n* Pricing review\n* Growth planning\n* Staffing structure analysis\n* Board salary reviews\n\n\n For more information contact Founder and CEO John Courtney and book an initial Zoom call at John@BoardroomAdvisors.co\n   \n\n  \n\n**www.BoardroomAdvisors.co**","company_url":"https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/company\/boardroom-advisors","company_url_direct":null,"company_addresses":null,"company_num_employees":null,"company_revenue":null,"company_description":null,"logo_photo_url":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/v2\/C4D0BAQH8xI0RAV2C4Q\/company-logo_100_100\/company-logo_100_100\/0\/1630556918255\/boardroom_advisors_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=vjdGFz_FL5uPmxXdkD2L7prazs1lCcLBMyykCXNiA9E","banner_photo_url":null,"ceo_name":null,"ceo_photo_url":null},{"id":"4112279876","site":"linkedin","job_url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/view\/4112279876","job_url_direct":"https:\/\/grnh.se\/add79f1a1us&urlHash=1am6","title":"Technical Account Manager","company":"Vectra AI","location":"Stockholm, Stockholm County, Sweden","job_type":"fulltime","date_posted":null,"salary_source":null,"interval":null,"min_amount":null,"max_amount":null,"currency":null,"is_remote":null,"job_level":"mid-senior level","job_function":"Sales and Business Development","company_industry":"Technology, Information and Internet","listing_type":null,"emails":null,"description":"Vectra\u00ae is the leader in AI-driven threat detection and response for hybrid and multi-cloud enterprises.\n   \n\n  \n\n The Vectra AI Platform delivers integrated signal across public cloud, SaaS, identity, and data center networks in a single platform.

Some of us work on the visible parts, making our services easy on the eye and some of us focus on the unseen magic happening behind the scenes. \u2728\n   \n\n  \n\n Our Engineers handle the whole development process (business logic, testing, database & data streaming, CI\/CD, analytics, cloud) in an autonomous manner. They build things that are accessible and made to scale. They keep our systems in the best shape by simplifying the unnecessary complexity.\n   \n\n  \n\n We make the decisions as a team and group of teams for our ways of working and we take architectural decisions together.

This is where our integration platform comes in. We help our merchant partners automate the manual work with our API and integration offerings. Once a merchant has these integrations in place, their staff are free to do what they do best - service consumers without being bogged down by mundane, repetitive, and error prone manual processes. Through our API platform, we ensure that the experience for our partners is best in class, making it a breeze to work with Wolt. Be it orders going to POS (Point of Sale) systems automatically, venue management, item & inventory control, menu & catalog automation, our teams have our merchants covered!\n   \n\n  \n\n**Merchant Operations** \n : In recent years, we started expanding our delivery offering to new verticals beyond restaurant deliveries, including grocery, pharmacy, merchandise, flowers, and apparel, all referred to as \u201cRetail\u201d.

Wolt Market is a chain of dark grocery stores available on Wolt\u2019s well known delivery platform. Wolt Market delivers groceries to our users within 30 minutes.
