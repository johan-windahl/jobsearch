And on the face of things, that might not sound exciting. But, to our customers and us, it really is. We believe that the way that work works today is outdated. We think companies can delegate to their employees more - to support their autonomy and show them trust. To speak to this, we provide smart credit cards for businesses. No more expense reports, no more out-of-pocket spending. This puts trust in employees so that they can buy what they need when they need it. Future of work stuff, you know?\n   \n\n  \n\n What\u2019s more, we\u2019re passionate about investing in our people, our processes and our product offerings, which is why we\u2019ve recently launched our Credit domain. Domains are autonomous areas of the business made up of cross functional teams that are responsible for tackling particular problems or opportunities that enable our vision.\n   \n\n  \n\n The credit domain empowers users with better cash flow and ensures they can rely on Pleo for their most critical spending needs. The domain aims to create end-to-end ownership of Credit products and capabilities. We own the design of credit products, risk and financial appetite, revenue model, and infrastructure that is required to deliver it.\n   \n\n  \n\n By learning from customers\u2019 spending behaviours, we can predict when a customer needs credit at the moment, which is most needed by companies. It also allows us to set the credit terms that fit best their needs. We see credit both as a product and as a set of capabilities that will help us unlock more value in other products across Pleo.\n   \n\n  \n\n For us to do this successfully, we\u2019re looking for someone to take control of collections and portfolio monitoring, to minimize our losses and ensure we can continue to offer customers the best version of the Pleo product.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Who we're looking for:**\n* A solution driven professional, who is able to autonomously overcome challenges and solve problems or blockers, always passionate about getting stuff done\n* A great communicator, who can create relationships, convince others with their ideas and simplify complex topics\n* A person eager to learn, strives for constant improvement and not afraid to fail\n\n\n**You will also be responsible for:**\n* Underwriting applications for large credit facilities which don\u2019t fall within our automated solutions\n* Feeding into our credit risk strategy, as well as all relevant processes for the team and its members\n* Providing business requirements to Product Managers and Operations Managers, automating manual processes and achieve higher efficiency\n* Maximizing our recovery rate and minimizing our loss rates\n* Analyzing the health of our portfolio, identifying where decisions we make or processes we follow require improvement\n\n\n**We believe you'll thrive in this role if you:**\n* Well experienced in underwriting, credit risk management within lending or credit control, in the SME space (as opposed to consumers)\n* Ideally have experience using SQL and PowerBI\n* Have monitored performance of portfolios of debt before, optimized for recovery and repayments\n* Have devised or assisted devising a collection strategy for your team\/company\n* Are able to constantly improve credit risk management frameworks and policies to optimize default rates\n\n\n**Your colleagues say that you are**\n* Curious by nature & love solving for inefficiencies\n* Happy to empower those around them\n* Love the detail, you often spot things that other don\u2019t\n* Razor sharp when it comes to your work but also fun to work with\n\n\n**Show me the benefits!**\n* Your own Pleo card (no more out-of-pocket spending!)\n* Lunch is on us - with catering in our Lisbon office \ud83c\udf5c\n* Private health insurance to ensure you\u2019re fit in body and mind to do your best work\n* In Portugal, we offer 25 days of holiday + your public holidays\n* For our Cash Flow Operations Team, we offer full flexibility around working from home\n* Option to purchase 5 additional days of holiday through a salary sacrifice\n* Wellbeing days - fully paid days off designed for a slower pace, allowing you to take time to recharge and prioritise self-care\n* We\u2019re trialling MyndUp to give our employees access to free mental health and wellbeing support with great success so far \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79\n* Access to LinkedIn Learning - acquire new skills, stay abreast of industry trends and fuel your personal and professional development continuously\n* Paid parental leave - we want to make sure that we're supportive of families and help you feel that you don't have to compromise your family due to work \ud83d\udc76\n* All of us have a stake in Pleo\u2019s success - ask us about our equity grant scheme\n\n\n**Why join us?**\n Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Our mission is to help every company go beyond the books. Pleo itself means \u2018more than you\u2019d expect\u2019, and it\u2019s been the secret to our success over the last 8 years. So it\u2019s only fitting that we\u2019d pass this philosophy onto our customers to help them make the most of their finances.\n   \n\n  \n\n We think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Finance teams shouldn\u2019t be siloed from the rest of the organisation \u2013 they should work in unity with marketing, sales, IT and everyone else.\n   \n\n  \n\n Speaking of working in unity, our values tell the story of how we work at Pleo. We have four core values, the first of which is \u2018champion the customer\u2019, which means we address real pain points that businesses face. Next up is \u2018succeed as a team\u2019, which highlights how our strength lies in our diversity and trust in each other. We also \u2018make it happen\u2019 by taking bold decisions and following through to deliver results. Last but not least, we \u2018build to scale\u2019, creating lasting solutions that address today\u2019s challenges and anticipate tomorrow\u2019s needs.\n   \n\n  \n\n So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 850+ team, from over 100 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal and Lisbon offices \u2014and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us, we'll help you set up the best remote setup possible\n *and* \n make sure you still have time to connect with your team.\n   \n\n  \n\n**About Your Application**\n* Please submit your application in English; it\u2019s our company language so you\u2019ll be speaking lots of it if you join \ud83d\udc95\n* We treat all candidates equally: If you are interested please apply through our application system - any correspondence should come from there!
