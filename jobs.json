Most teams operate on a bi-weekly planning cadence, though each group has flexibility in how they work.\n   \n\n  \n\n All teams present progress, learnings, and experiments during bi-weekly engineering demos, covering topics ranging from hardware and calibration challenges to infrastructure improvements, backend capabilities, and data innovations that enhance clinical productivity.\n   \n\n  \n\n Neko Health supports a flexible workplace that prioritizes work-life balance. We are deeply committed to our mission while believing meaningful impact should not require sacrificing personal wellbeing.\n   \n\n  \n\n Hiring Process\n   \n\n  \n\n Candidates begin with an initial recruiter screen focused on experience, motivations, and role alignment. Successful candidates then meet with the Hiring Leader for a deeper discussion on technical background and impact.\n   \n\n  \n\n Next, candidates complete technical assessments alongside existing team members, designed to reflect real-world challenges and collaboration.\n   \n\n  \n\n The process concludes with a final stage involving Engineering Leadership, focusing on long-term impact and alignment before moving to offer and pre-employment checks.\n   \n\n  \n\n Equal Opportunity & Inclusion Statement\n   \n\n  \n\n Neko Health is committed to inclusive hiring and equitable healthcare.

You're comfortable figuring things out, making decisions, and iterating quickly\n* You work with modern tools: You have hands-on experience with React, TypeScript, and Next.js. Bonus if you've worked with Tailwind CSS, Zustand, React Query, or component libraries like shadcn\/ui\n* You leverage AI as a tool, not a crutch: You know how to use tools like Claude Code, Cursor, or Copilot to move faster and ship better code \u2014 but you understand what you're building and why. AI slop doesn't pass your own code review\n* You're frontend-first, but not frontend-only: You're most at home building great user experiences, but you're comfortable navigating backend code when needed.

We mix that with the freedom to work from home when it makes sense, and hours that flex around real life.\n* **A culture of curiosity.** \n On Fridays we have weekly demos, Wednesdays mean lunch-and-learns, and sometimes we throw ourselves into conceptathons just to see what happens. We gather for company conferences just to share ideas, and we take time to learn something new when needed.\n* **The freedom to follow your \u201cwhat if.\u201d** \n We believe the best roles are shaped by the people in them. If you are curious about something, you will have the trust and space to chase it, and probably a few teammates who want to jump in with you.\n* **Teammates who bring their whole selves.** \n Designers who doodle during standups, engineers who can\u2019t resist showing off a clever hack, product leads who keep the energy up when things get tricky. Around here, people genuinely like sharing what they know and celebrating when someone tries something new.\n* **And of course, the benefits you\u2019d expect.** \n A generous wellness grant, top-up on your parental leave, occupational pension, and plenty more to make life outside of work easier.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**Our hiring process** \n\n\n\n1.

Good! We\u2019re shaping a new product team with a mission to overhaul how software is built and scaled.\n   \n\n  \n\n You will help create an enterprise-grade design system that connects design and code, enabling software to be built, edited, and shipped by describing intent in natural language. The goal isn\u2019t only about enabling new ways of building software for human usage, but also creating software that will be used by AI agents.\n   \n\n  \n\n This position is for a high-agency, multidisciplinary engineer who thinks beyond linear workflows and established patterns. Someone who cares deeply about craft, but is equally motivated by experimentation, systems thinking, and inventing better ways of working. You will work closely with designers and engineers to explore how design, engineering, delivery, and AI should work together in practice inside a real enterprise environment.\n   \n\n  \n\n You will establish principles, architecture and processes that enable the product organization to become AI-first through using the new design system. A core part of the role is shaping how AI generates templates, screens, and flows by learning from design system components, markdown, templates, and user flows within our enterprise landscape.\n   \n\n  \n\n You will:\n   \n\n  \n\n* Own the technical foundation of an AI-first, scalable enterprise design system.\n* Translate design into code and continuously improve the system.\n* Experiment with and establish AI-assisted workflows for design and engineering, using tools such as Figma Make, Vercel AI SDK, Replit, and Cursor.\n* Shape how design system assets are created, versioned, and used when AI is part of the workflow.\n* Reduce manual handoffs and repetitive work through better system structure, tooling, automation and by using ready-made assets from e.g. Tailwind.\n* Build and maintain reusable frontend components with attention to accessibility, interaction, and consistency.\n* Design workflows across MCPs, Storybook, Vercel AI SDK, and module federation.\n* Support other engineers by making the design system clear, reliable, and easy to adopt.\n* Document learnings, patterns, and guidelines.\n\n\n**Your profile**\n* Fundamentally excited about how AI can improve the way products are built.\n* You\u2019ve experimented with a bunch of AI tools in the past few years and have a desire to improve ways of working with the help of your learnings.\n* Fluent in modern TypeScript, primarily React, GitHub synchronization, Tailwind, Storybook, and willing to dive into Figma MCP.\n* Skilled at turning design intent into production-ready code and bringing static screens to life through interaction and motion.\n* Experienced implementing design systems and translating Figma designs into production-ready code, adhering to accessibility-focused practices.\n* Strong visual sensibility. You notice the difference when elements are off by a pixel or spacing is slightly off rhythm.\n* Cares about typography, grids, responsive scales, and meaningful animation.\n* Collaborative and detail-obsessed. You work well with designers and see code as a form of creative expression.\n* Comfortable navigating ambiguity.\n* You\u2019ve shipped real products and you care deeply about the user's experience.\n* Familiar with Figma Tokens, Tokens Studio, or similar tools.\n\n\n**Application**\n Do you feel this description matches your profile? We warmly welcome your application and look forward to reading it. Please note that including a link to your portfolio is essential for your application to be considered.\n   \n\n  \n\n**What You'll Like About Working Here**\n We are shaping a new class of AI-first enterprise platforms and the design systems that support them.
