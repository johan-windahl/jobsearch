And that successful leaders need to adopt a curious and collaborative mindset in order to get there. So with you at Mentimeter, you\u2019ll be a big part of the ambition to help over 1 billion people listen, learn and work better together.\n   \n\n  \n\n As Mentimeter continues to scale, our platform must scale with us. This is where you come in.\n   \n\n  \n\n We\u2019re looking for a Platform Engineer with deep experience in cloud infrastructure, someone who has worked in multiple environments and brings strong opinions and fresh perspectives. We also value thoughtful, collaborative discussions around architectural choices. You\u2019ll help us shape, design, and operate a platform that is reliable, secure, cost-efficient, and empowering for developers to work with.\n   \n\n  \n\n In this role, you\u2019ll work broadly across our infrastructure stack: compute, networking, observability, tooling and developer experience. You\u2019ll collaborate with engineering teams across the company to ensure our platform enables them to move quickly while maintaining a high standard of stability and quality.\n   \n\n  \n\n You\u2019ll champion modern platform engineering practices, experiment with new approaches, and support a culture of continuous learning and improvement.\n   \n\n  \n\n This role is ideal for someone who remains hands-on, loves trying new approaches, and values pairing with other teams, exploring trade-offs, and having open, collaborative discussions.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Who You Are**\n For this role, we\u2019re looking for someone with:\n   \n\n  \n\n* Experience building and operating cloud infrastructure, ideally across multiple organizations, bringing a breadth of insights and best practices.\n* You understand the major components of cloud infrastructure in AWS (or a similar cloud provider) and bring strong, experience-backed opinions on building secure, reliable, and efficient systems.\n* Hands-on coding skills and the desire to continue writing and reviewing code.\n* You communicate clearly, collaborate well with product teams, and can balance deep technical thinking with broader product impact.\n* You\u2019re curious, open-minded, and eager to explore new technologies and approaches.\n* An interest in working with our stack: AWS, Terraform, Cloudflare, Ruby, TypeScript \u2014 even if you haven\u2019t used all of them before.\n\n\n We care more about your mindset and experience than an exact match of technology skills.\n   \n\n  \n\n**What Mentimeter Can Offer**\n At Mentimeter we can offer a diverse and inclusive work environment supported by smart and driven colleagues. We believe in continuous professional development for all of our colleagues and therefore offer access to a leadership program (including external personal coach) and relevant education to ensure that we continue to be state-of-the-art when it comes to innovating and building Mentimeter. Your place will be in a growing company with lots of career opportunities, working on a beloved product used by more than 300 million people. It\u2019s not all about work though, we also offer a very healthy view on work-life balance.\n   \n\n  \n\n All of this comes attached with a competitive compensation and benefits package, including pension contributions. Learn more about our benefits by visiting our Benefits & Perks page\n   \n\n  \n\n**AI and Hiring at Mentimeter**\n At Mentimeter, we believe AI helps us work smarter - but it never replaces the human assessment, curiosity, and personal connection that define our culture and our hiring. We use AI as a sparring partner: to bounce ideas, bring new perspectives, support structure, and make our work more efficient. But the meaning, decisions, and interactions always come from people.\n   \n\n  \n\n* AI does not screen or decide on candidates.\n* There is no automated filtering, ranking, or decision-making in our recruitment process. Every application is reviewed by a person.\n* Hiring teams may use AI to support their work - for example, to structure notes, prepare interview questions, or organize their thinking.\n\n\n AI strengthens our work, but it does not define it. At Mentimeter, we\u2019re not building an AI-driven hiring process - we\u2019re building a people-first culture, where technology helps us listen, learn, and grow together.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Culture at Mentimeter**\n At Mentimeter we believe in giving everyone a voice - regardless of who you are. So we build a platform that does just that. Our platform is not only our product but also our organization. A platform where people feel safe, where differences are embraced, a place where you can have fun. We strongly encourage applicants who are people of color, LGBTQ+, women, people with disabilities, and\/or formerly incarcerated people, and a college degree is not strictly required. In order to give everyone a voice, we need to be as diverse as our users.\n   \n\n  \n\n Learn more about our culture by visiting our Culture page.\n   \n\n  \n\n Review our Privacy Policy for more information.","company_url":"https:\/\/se.linkedin.com\/company\/mentimeter","company_url_direct":null,"company_addresses":null,"company_industry":null,"company_num_employees":null,"company_revenue":null,"company_description":null,"logo_photo_url":"https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/v2\/D560BAQEUVjnirG3B-w\/company-logo_100_100\/B56ZUjdju7GQAQ-\/0\/1740056706530\/mentimeter_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=fy5ibQx-tPCWjidbNoyMsr3mQPtso9Fyxa7wPI1j4sQ","banner_photo_url":null,"ceo_name":null,"ceo_photo_url":null},{"id":"4346817024","site":"linkedin","job_url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/view\/4346817024","job_url_direct":"https:\/\/grnh.se\/sp4edmcg1us&urlHash=Vqzo","title":"Software Engineering Manager - Container and Virtualisation Infrastructure","company":"Canonical","location":"Stockholm, Stockholm County, Sweden","job_type":"fulltime","date_posted":null,"interval":null,"min_amount":null,"max_amount":null,"currency":null,"is_remote":null,"emails":null,"description":"Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets.

Every application is reviewed by a person.\n* Hiring teams may use AI to support their work - for example, to structure notes, prepare interview questions, or organize their thinking.\n\n\n AI strengthens our work, but it does not define it. At Mentimeter, we\u2019re not building an AI-driven hiring process - we\u2019re building a people-first culture, where technology helps us listen, learn, and grow together.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Culture at Mentimeter**\n At Mentimeter we believe in giving everyone a voice - regardless of who you are.
