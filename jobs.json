Your main focus will be in one of the areas but you will collaborate closely with other Staff Engineers, Engineering Directors, and our CTO.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Role**\n This is a new and strategically important role at Avanza, giving you significant influence over the scope, mandate, and long-term direction of the role. You will:\n   \n\n  \n\n* Provide technical leadership and mentoring across teams, helping teams make high-quality engineering decisions.\n* Guide architectural work: design scalable, secure, and sustainable solutions and support teams in breaking down complexity.\n* Drive Avanza\u2019s broader technical direction, such as cloud transformation, global expansion, AI and personalization.\n* Collaborate deeply with product, engineering leads, and other stakeholders to align technology with business and area goals.\n* Explore new technologies, challenge old assumptions, and contribute to our long-term strategy through vision, insight, and hands-on when needed.\n\n\n As the role is practical, collaborative, and highly influential, we prefer that you work on site from our head office in Stockholm 3-4 days per week. We believe the best results emerge in secure and trusting teams where everyone is heard.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Who We\u2019re Looking For**\n You are likely an experienced Staff or Principal Engineer, or bring equivalent senior technical leadership experience from a similar role. Most importantly, you\u2019re someone who thrives in change, believes in inclusive collaboration, and wants to help shape a modern engineering organization.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Required Experience**\n* Previous experience as Staff\/Principal Engineer or similar senior technical leadership role.\n* Demonstrated extensive experience working in cloud (preferably GCP or AWS).\n* Strong ability to guide teams, mentor engineers, and lead technical initiatives across multiple domains.\n* Proven capability to solve complex problems and make data-informed architectural decisions.\n* Excellent communication skills with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\n\n\n**Meritorious Experience**\n* Strategy work within AI-assisted development.\n* Experience working in regulated environments (finance or fintech is a plus).\n\n\n We\u2019re looking for someone who combines confidence with humility \u2014 a collaborative team player who listens well and values diverse perspectives. You think strategically but are equally comfortable stepping in hands-on when needed. You\u2019re curious, proactive, and genuinely passionate about modern technology, and you thrive in a fast-evolving environment where solving complex problems is part of the everyday. You like to see things progress. When things get stuck, you step in, take ownership, and resolve them.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Our Culture**\n We are currently a Swedish-speaking organization, but we welcome English-speaking candidates for this role \u2014 as long as you\u2019re comfortable working in an environment where much of the daily communication, meetings, and documentation is still in Swedish. This is something that may evolve over time.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Application**\n Submit your application by clicking the \"Apply\" button below. We will start reviewing applications and book interviews after January 12th 2026 and the final application date is 23\/1-26.\n   \n\n  \n\n Apply today and join us on our transformation journey!\n   \n\n  \n\n*We kindly decline offers from recruitment agencies\/advertising vendors*\n Avanza \u00e4r Sveriges ledande plattform f\u00f6r sparande och placeringar.

We also deliver real-time parcel data and location insights, enabling smooth and transparent operations across our entire sorting network.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Our Vision**\n Our objective is ambitious, We strive to achieve operational excellence across our 40+ terminals in Europe. Any parcel should be able to enter the terminal sorting network at any point and immediately be ready for the next step towards its destination.
